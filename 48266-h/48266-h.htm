war as it is harder to guard against what is secret than what is open,&mdash;and

<p>Except the Tax Bill, no subject occupied so much attention during
this session as what were known generally as “Confiscation Bills,” all
proposing, in different ways, the punishment of Rebels and the weakening
of the Rebellion, by taking property and freeing slaves. In supporting
these bills, Mr. Sumner did not disguise his special anxiety to
assert the power of Congress over Slavery.</p>

<p>As early as January 15th, Mr. Trumbull reported from the Judiciary
Committee a bill to confiscate the property and free the slaves of Rebels,
which was considered from time to time and debated at length,
many Senators speaking. Amendments were made, among which was
one moved by Mr. Sumner, February 25th, requiring, that, whenever
any person claimed another as slave, he should, before proceeding with
his claim, prove loyalty.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Then came motions for reference of the
pending bill and all associate propositions to a Select Committee. That
of Mr. Clark prevailed. In a speech which will be found in the <i>Congressional
Globe</i><a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> sustaining the reference, Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Such are the embarrassments in which we are involved, such is the
maze into which we have been led by these various motions, that a committee
is needed to hold the clew. Never was there more occasion for such
a committee than now, when we have all these multifarious propositions to
be considered, revised, collated, and brought into a constitutional unit,&mdash;or,
if I may so say, changing the figure, passed through an alembic, to be
fused into one bill on which we can all harmonize.”</p></div>

<p>Mr. Clark reported from the Select Committee a bill “to suppress
Insurrection and punish Treason and Rebellion,” which, on the 16th of
May, was taken up for consideration. Mr. Sumner was among those
who thought the bill inadequate, and on the day it was taken up he
introduced a substitute in ten sections, which was printed by order of
the Senate. The title was, “For the Confiscation of Property and the
Liberation of Slaves belonging to Rebels.” The sections relating to
Liberation were these.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sec. 6.</span> <i>And be it further enacted</i>, That, if any person within any State
or Territory of the United States shall, after the passage of this Act, wilfully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>engage in armed rebellion against the Government of the United States, or
shall wilfully aid or abet such rebellion, or adhere to those engaged in such
rebellion, giving them aid or comfort, every such person shall thereby forfeit
all claim to the service or labor of any persons commonly known as
slaves; and all such slaves are hereby declared free, and forever discharged
from such servitude, anything in the laws of the United States, or of any
State, to the contrary notwithstanding. And whenever thereafter any person
claiming the labor or service of any such slave shall seek to enforce his
claim, it shall be a sufficient defence thereto that the claimant was engaged
in the said rebellion, or aided or abetted the same, contrary to the provisions
of this Act.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sec. 7.</span> <i>And be it further enacted</i>, That, whenever any person claiming
to be entitled to the service or labor of any other person shall seek to enforce
such claim, he shall, in the first instance, and before any order shall be made
for the surrender of the person whose service or labor is claimed, establish
not only his claim to such service or labor, but also that such claimant has
not in any way aided, assisted, or countenanced the existing Rebellion against
the Government of the United States. And no person engaged in the military
or naval service of the United States shall, under any pretence whatever,
assume to decide on the validity of the claim of any person to the
service or labor of any other person, or deliver up any such person to the
claimant, on pain of being dismissed from the service.”</p>

</div>

<p>May 19th, Mr. Sumner made the following speech, vindicating the
powers of Congress.</p>

<p>A debate ensued, turning on the inadequacy of the pending bill, in
which Mr. Sumner likened it to a glass of water with a bit of orange-peel,
which, according to a character in one of Dickens’s novels, by
making believe very hard, would be a strong drink, and said: “At
a moment when the life of the Republic is struck at, Senators would
proceed by indictment in a criminal court.” Mr. Wade said: “I do
not know that we shall get anything; but if we only get this bill, we
shall get next to nothing.”</p>

<p>In the course of the debate, Mr. Davis departed from the main question
to say that he understood the Senators from Massachusetts sympathized
with the mob in Boston, and its resistance to the Fugitive Slave
Act. He never knew that Mr. Wilson had appeared “to back the
Marshal of the United States in the execution of that law.” Then
ensued a brief colloquy.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Mr. Davis.</span> I never heard that he did, or that either of them did, perform
or attempt to perform that high, patriotic duty.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I was in my seat here.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Mr. Davis.</span> Did you not give your sympathy to those who resisted the
law?</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
<p>“<span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> My sympathy is always with every slave.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Mr. Davis.</span> That is a frank acknowledgment. His sympathy is with
every slave against the Constitution and the execution of the laws of his
country! If that is not a sentiment of treason, I ask what is.”<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Meanwhile the House of Representatives were considering the same
subject, and on the 26th May passed a bill “to confiscate the property
of Rebels for the payment of the expenses of the present Rebellion, and
for other purposes,” which, on motion of Mr. Clark, was taken up in
the Senate June 23d, when he moved to substitute the pending Senate
bill. The debate on the general question was resumed. June 27th,
Mr. Sumner made another speech, which will be found in its place, according
to date,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> especially in reply to Mr. Browning, who had claimed
the War Powers for the President rather than for Congress.</p>

<p>June 28th, the substitute moved by Mr. Clark was agreed to, Yeas
19, Nays 17, and the bill as amended was then passed, Yeas 28, Nays
13.</p>

<p>July 3d, the House non-concurred in the Senate amendment. A
Conference Committee reported in substance the Senate amendment,
which was accepted in the Senate, Yeas 28, Nays 13, and in the
House, Yeas 82, Nays 42. July 17th, the bill was signed by the
President.</p>

<p>The sections of this bill, as it passed, relating to liberation, were
these.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sec. 9.</span> <i>And be it further enacted</i>, That all slaves of persons who shall
hereafter be engaged in rebellion against the Government of the United

such persons and taking refuge within the lines of the army, and all slaves
captured from such persons, or deserted by them, and coming under the
control of the Government of the United States, and all slaves of such persons
found on [or] being within any place occupied by Rebel forces, and
afterwards occupied by the forces of the United States, shall be deemed
captives of war, and shall be forever free of their servitude, and not again
held as slaves.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sec. 10.</span> <i>And be it further enacted</i>, That no slave escaping into any

shall first make oath that the person to whom the labor or service of
such fugitive is alleged to be due is his lawful owner, and has not borne
arms against the United States in the present Rebellion, nor in any way

<p>This speech in the Washington pamphlet was entitled “Indemnity
for the Past and Security for the Future,” which points directly at
its object. An edition was printed in New York by the Young Men’s
Republican Union, with the title, “Rights of Sovereignty and Rights
of War, Two Sources of Power against the Rebellion,” which describes
the way in which this object might be accomplished.</p>

<p>It was noticed at the time as removing difficulties which perplexed
many with regard to the powers of Congress.</p>

<p>In Paris, the <i>Journal des Débats</i><a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> referred to it as explaining the confiscation
proposed in the United States, and quoted passages especially
in reply to the <i>Constitutionnel</i>, which had attacked the measure.</p>

<p>A few opinions are given, merely to illustrate the tone of comment.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Hon. John Jay, afterwards our Minister at Vienna, who sympathized
promptly with all that was done to crush the Rebellion, wrote from
New York:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Your Confiscation speech is an admirable exposition of the subject, and
will go far to remove any lingering doubts in the public mind in regard to
the constitutionality and necessity of the measure.”</p>

</div>

<p>Then again he wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have re-read, with thorough satisfaction, your speech on Confiscation
and Emancipation in the pamphlet you were good enough to send me. It
is admirable in its tone, arrangement, and completeness, and the arguments
and illustrations are overwhelming and unanswerable. The necessity of
Emancipation is fast forcing itself upon our people by the stern logic of
facts, but your speech will remove any lingering doubts.”</p>

</div>

<p>Hon. Amos P. Granger, former Representative in Congress, and a
stern patriot, wrote from Syracuse, New York:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Your remarks of the 19th, as reported in the <i>Tribune</i> day before yesterday,
are read in this vicinity with a great deal of pleasure and approbation.
They are replete with prudence, skill, and wisdom. Such sentiments
are rarely heard in Washington. It would seem that they would be
decisive.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>Hon. William L. Marshall, an able Judge of Maryland, wrote from
Baltimore:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“You have exhausted the subject, it seems to me, so far as it involves
legal questions. I have been greatly pleased and much interested by your
argument.”</p>

</div>

<p>L. D. Stickney, of Florida, wrote from Washington:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have read your speech on the confiscation of the property of Rebels with
the liveliest interest and with entire approbation. Long a citizen of the
South, I have nevertheless been a steadfast Republican of the school of Jefferson
and of J. Quincy Adams,&mdash;a Republican to elevate men to the proper
status of freemen, not to degrade them to slavery. While the unthinking
and those of violent prejudices call you fanatical, no man properly qualified
to judge of men and events can survey your parliamentary history without
acknowledging your claim to the highest plane of statesmanship. I reverence
Sir James Mackintosh as the brightest example of great men whom the
world will not willingly let die. Tried by no other standard than your
speeches in the Thirty-Seventh Congress alone, you will stand unchallenged
by the enlightened judgment of mankind, his co-rival in that fame which
makes his name cherished by scholars everywhere, and by all men of good
report.”</p>

</div>

<p>While expressing sympathy with this speech, many at this time, like
the last writer, referred to the series of efforts by Mr. Sumner during
this session. Among these was Hon. Samuel E. Sewall, of Boston, the
able lawyer and tried Abolitionist, who repeated the kindly appreciation
which he had expressed on other occasions.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Your course during the present session has not only delighted your
friends, but I think has given great satisfaction to the mass of your constituents,
as well as to all throughout the country whose opinions are of any
value.</p>

<p>“Any man might think his life well spent, who, in its whole course, had
said and done no more in the cause of freedom and justice than you have in
the six months past.”</p>

</div>

<p>Hon. Charles W. Upham, the author, and former Representative in
Congress, wrote from Salem:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“You have nobly presented and thoroughly exhausted all the subjects
you have treated. I rejoice in your success, and cordially indorse your sentiments.
May you live to witness the progressive triumphs of the great
cause to which you are devoted!”</p>

</div>

<p>Lewis Tappan, often quoted already, wrote from New York:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“You have done a great work in the Senate during the last session. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>admire your consistency. Every utterance has been instinct with liberty
and loyalty.… Thanking you again for the speech, and for your other
speeches, and thanking God for the brilliancy of your entire Senatorial career.…”</p>

</div>

<p>Hon. Asaph Churchill, lawyer and fellow-student, expressed his
sympathy, and gave a reminiscence, in a letter from Boston.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Allow me to congratulate you upon the grand success of our country’s
movement, and no less upon your own career, which has been crowned with
such splendid success, during the past season, in the new, important, and
delicate questions which you have been called upon to speak and act upon.
Certainly your highest ambition ought to be satisfied with that which insures
to you your place in the immortality of history; and you have had the
most abundant opportunity for accomplishing upon the grandest scale that
aspiration which I so well remember you gave utterance to at our Law
School, when, boy-like, we were all telling what we most ardently sought
to do or to be, that you ‘wished to do that which would do the most good
to mankind.’”</p>

</div>

<p>Wendell Phillips, after his return from a lecture-tour, wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Be of good courage. We all say amen to you. And your diocese, <em>I</em> can
testify, extends to the Mississippi.”</p>

</div>

<p>Alfred E. Giles, lawyer, wrote from Boston:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“During your Congressional career, I have so uniformly found my views
and feelings on public affairs in accordance with those of your speeches,
that I now feel myself obliged, for once at least (for I shall not often trouble
you), to express my gratitude, and give a word of good cheer to you, who,
amid so many discouragements, and under so much obloquy as has been
attempted to be thrown upon you, have ever so faithfully and manfully stood
up for the oppressed and for liberal principles.</p>

<p>“It appears to me, on reading your speeches, that I find my own views
and principles announced, stated, and clothed with a richness and beauty of
style and illustration that I admire, but cannot emulate.</p>

<p>“Again, I am much pleased that you always deal fairly with your opponents,
not using misrepresentation and <i>ad captandum</i> argument, but drawing
your weapons from the armory of truth and right.”</p>

</div>

<p>Professor Ordronaux, of Columbia College, New York, wrote:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Last year, while in England, I had the honor of meeting many gentlemen
of your acquaintance, and, amid the many bitter things I was compelled
to listen to, it was a source of constant satisfaction and pride to hear them
acknowledge the great confidence they reposed in you, and the earnest wish
they expressed for the success of that <i>novus ordo sæclorum</i> in the Senate,
for which we are so much indebted to you. Reading over for the third time
your famous Kansas speech, of May, 1856,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> this morning, I was struck with
the almost prophetic character of its language. The crime against Nature
has indeed culminated. It struck you down, and then went dancing like a
maniac, all the while approaching that bottomless abyss into which it is now
descending. Can you doubt that Nemesis still wields her sword and flaming
torch?”</p>

</div>

<p>These expressions of sympathy and good-will, overflowing from opposite
quarters, are a proper prelude to other utterances, widely different
in tone, aroused against Mr. Sumner by the very persistency of his
course. Appearing in their proper place, these will be better comprehended
from knowing already the other side.</p>

<h3>SPEECH.</h3>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;If I can simplify this discussion,
I shall feel that I have done something towards
establishing the truth. The chief difficulty springs
from confusion with regard to different sources of power.
This I shall try to remove.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is a saying, often repeated by statesmen and
often recorded by publicists, which embodies the direct
object of the war we are now unhappily compelled to
wage,&mdash;an object sometimes avowed in European wars,
and more than once made a watchword in our own
country: “Indemnity for the past, and Security for the
future.” Such should be our comprehensive aim,&mdash;nor
more, nor less. Without indemnity for the past, this
war will have been waged at our cost; without security
for the future, this war will have been waged in
vain, treasure and blood will have been lavished for
nothing. But indemnity and security are both means
to an end, and that end is the National Unity under
the Constitution of the United States. It is not enough,
if we preserve the Constitution at the expense of the
National Unity. Nor is it enough, if we enforce the
National Unity at the expense of the Constitution.
Both must be maintained. Both will be maintained,
if we do not fail to take counsel of that prudent courage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
which is never so much needed as at a moment like
the present.</p>

<p>Two things we seek as means to an end: Indemnity
for the past, and Security for the future.</p>

<p>Two things we seek as the end itself: National Unity,
under the Constitution of the United States.</p>

<p>In these objects all must concur. But how shall they
be best accomplished?</p>

<p>The Constitution and International Law are each involved
in this discussion. Even if the question itself
were minute, it would be important from such relations.
But it concerns vast masses of property, and, what is
more than property, it concerns the liberty of men, while
it opens for decision the means to be employed in bringing
this great war to a close. In every aspect the question
is transcendent; nor is it easy to pass upon it
without the various lights of <em>jurisprudence</em>, of <em>history</em>,
and of <em>policy</em>.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is called a constitutional question exclusively.
This is a mistake. In every Government
bound by written Constitution nothing is done except
in conformity with the Constitution. But in the present
debate there need be no difficulty or doubt under
the Constitution. Its provisions are plain and explicit,
so that they need only to be recited. The Senator from
Pennsylvania [Mr. <span class="smcap">Cowan</span>] and the Senator from Vermont
[Mr. <span class="smcap">Collamer</span>] have stated them strongly; but
I complain less of their statement than of its application.
Of course, any proposition really inconsistent
with these provisions must be abandoned. But if, on
the other hand, it be consistent, then is the way open
to its consideration in the lights of history and policy.</p>

<p>If there be any difficulty now, it is not from the question,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
but simply from the facts,&mdash;as often in judicial
proceedings it is less embarrassing to determine the law
than the facts. If things are seen as they really are
and not as Senators fancy or desire, if the facts are admitted
in their natural character, then must the constitutional
power of the Government be admitted also, for
this power comes into being on the occurrence of certain
facts. Only by denying the facts can the power
itself be drawn in question. But not even the Senator
from Pennsylvania or the Senator from Vermont
denies the facts.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The facts are simple and obvious. They are all expressed
or embodied in the double idea of Rebellion
and War. Both of these are facts patent to common
observation and common sense. It would be an insult
to the understanding to say that at the present moment
there is no Rebellion or that there is no War. Whatever
the doubts of Senators, or their fine-spun constitutional
theories, nobody questions that we are in the
midst of <i>de facto</i> Rebellion and in the midst of <i>de facto</i>
War. We are in the midst of each and of both. It is
not enough to say that there is Rebellion; nor is it enough
to say that there is War. The whole truth is not told
in either alternative. Our case is double, and you may
call it Rebellion or War, as you please, or you may call
it both. It is Rebellion swollen to all the proportions
of war, and it is War deriving its life from rebellion.
It is not less Rebellion because of its present full-blown
grandeur, nor is it less War because of the traitorous
source whence it draws its life.</p>

<p>The Rebellion is manifest,&mdash;is it not? An extensive
territory, once occupied by Governments rejoicing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
in allegiance to the Union, and sharing largely in its
counsels, has undertaken to overthrow the National
Constitution within its borders. Its Senators and Representatives
have withdrawn from Congress. The old
State Governments, solemnly bound by the oaths of
their functionaries to support the National Constitution,
have vanished; and in their place appear pretended
Governments, which, adopting the further pretension
of a Confederacy, have proceeded to issue letters
of marque and to levy war against the United States.
So far has displacement of the National Government
prevailed, that at this moment, throughout this whole
territory, there are no functionaries acting under the
United States, but all are pretending to act under the
newly established Usurpation. Instead of the oath to
support the Constitution of the United States, required
of all officials by the Constitution, another oath is substituted,
to support the Constitution of the Confederacy;
and thus the Rebellion assumes a completeness of organization
under the most solemn sanctions. In point
of fact, throughout this territory the National Government
is ousted, while the old State Governments have
ceased to exist, lifeless now from Rebel hands. Call it
suicide, if you will, or suspended animation, or abeyance,&mdash;they
have practically ceased to exist. Such is
the plain and palpable fact. If all this is not rebellion,
complete in triumphant treason, then is rebellion
nothing but a name.</p>

<p>But the War is not less manifest. Assuming all the
functions of an independent government, the Confederacy
has undertaken to declare war against the United
States. In support of this declaration it has raised armies,
organized a navy, issued letters of marque, borrowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
money, imposed taxes, and otherwise done all
that it could in waging war. Its armies are among
the largest ever marshalled by a single people, and at
different places throughout a wide-spread territory they
have encountered the armies of the United States. Battles
are fought with the varying vicissitudes of war.
Sieges are laid. Fortresses and cities are captured. On
the sea, ships bearing the commission of the Rebellion,
sometimes as privateers and sometimes as ships of the
navy, seize, sink, or burn merchant vessels of the United
States; and only lately an iron-clad steamer, with
the flag of the Rebellion, destroyed two frigates of the
United States. On each side prisoners are made, who
are treated as prisoners of war, and as such exchanged.
Flags of truce pass from camp to camp, and almost daily
during the winter this white flag has afforded its belligerent
protection to communications between Norfolk
and Fortress Monroe, while the whole Rebel coast is
by proclamation of the President declared in a state of
blockade, and ships of foreign countries, as well as of
our own, are condemned by courts in Washington, Philadelphia,
New York, and Boston, as prize of war. Thus
do all things attest the existence of war, which is manifest
now in the blockade, upheld by judicial tribunals,
and now in the bugle, which after night sounds truce,
indubitably as in mighty armies face to face on the battle-field.
It is war in all its criminal eminence, challenging
all the pains and penalties of war, enlisting all
its terrible prerogatives, and awaking all its dormant
thunder.</p>

<p>Further effort is needless to show that we are in the
midst of a Rebellion and in the midst of a War,&mdash;or, in
yet other words, that unquestionable war is now waged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
to put down unquestionable rebellion. But a single
illustration out of many in history will exhibit this
double character in unmistakable relief. The disturbances
which convulsed England in the middle of the
seventeenth century were occasioned by the resistance of
Parliament to the arbitrary power of the Crown. This
resistance, prolonged for years and maintained by force,
triumphed at last in the execution of King Charles and
the elevation of Oliver Cromwell. The historian whose
classical work was for a long time the chief authority
relative to this event styles it “The Rebellion,” and
under this name it passed into the memory of men.
But it was none the less war, with all the incidents of
war. The fields of Naseby, Marston Moor, Dunbar, and
Worcester, where Cavaliers and Puritans met in bloody
shock, attest that it was war. Clarendon called it Rebellion,
and the title of one of his works makes it “The
Grand Rebellion,”&mdash;how small by the side of ours! But
a greater than Clarendon&mdash;John Milton&mdash;called it War,
when, in unsurpassed verses, after commemorating the
victories of Cromwell, he uses words so often quoted
without knowing their original application:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent9">“Yet much remains</div>
<div class="verse">To conquer still: Peace hath her victories</div>
<div class="verse">No less renowned than War.”<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The death of Cromwell was followed by the restoration
of King Charles the Second; but the royal fugitive from
the field of Worcester, where Cromwell triumphed in
war, did not fail to put forth the full prerogatives of
sovereignty in the suppression of rebellion; and all who
sat in judgment on the king, his father, were saved from
the fearful penalties of treason only by exile. Hugh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
Peters, the Puritan preacher, and Harry Vane, the Puritan
senator, were executed as traitors for the part they
performed in what was at once rebellion and war,
while the body of the great commander who defeated
his king in battle, and then sat upon his throne, was
hung in chains, as a warning against treason.</p>

<p>Other instances might be given to illustrate the double
character of present events. But enough is done. My
simple object is to exhibit this important point in such
light that it will be at once recognized. And I present
the Rebellion and the War as obvious <em>facts</em>. Let them be
seen in their true character, and it is easy to apply the
law. Because Senators see the facts only imperfectly,
they hesitate with regard to the powers we are to employ,&mdash;or
perhaps it is because they insist upon seeing
the fact of Rebellion exclusively, and not the fact of
War. Let them open their eyes, and they must see
both. If I seem to dwell on this point, it is because
of its practical importance in the present debate. For
myself, I assume it as an undeniable postulate.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The persons arrayed for the overthrow of the Government
of the United States are unquestionably <em>criminals</em>,
subject to all the penalties of rebellion, which is of
course treason under the Constitution of the United
States.</p>

<p>The same persons arrayed in war against the Government
of the United States are unquestionably <em>enemies</em>,
exposed to all the incidents of war, with its penalties,
seizures, contributions, confiscations, captures, and
prizes.</p>

<p>They are <em>criminals</em>, because they set themselves traitorously
against the Government of their country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>They are <em>enemies</em>, because their combination assumes
the front and proportions of war.</p>

<p>It is idle to say that they are not criminals. It is
idle to say that they are not enemies. They are both,
and they are either; and it is for the Government of
the United States to proceed against them in either
character, according to controlling considerations of
policy. This right is so obvious, on grounds of reason,
that it seems superfluous to sustain it by authority.
But since its recognition is essential to the complete
comprehension of our present position, I shall not hesitate
to illustrate it by judicial decisions, and also by an
earlier voice.</p>

<p>A judgment of the Supreme Court of the United
States cannot bind the Senate on this question; but
it is an important guide, to which we all bow with
respect. In the best days of this eminent tribunal,
when Marshall was Chief Justice, in a case arising
out of the efforts of France to suppress insurrection in
the colony of San Domingo, it was affirmed by the Court
that in such a case there were two distinct sources of
power open to exercise by a government,&mdash;one found
in the rights of a sovereign, the other in the rights of
a belligerent, or, in other words, one under Municipal
Law, and the other under International Law,&mdash;and the
exercise of one did not prevent the exercise of the
other. Belligerent rights, it was admitted, might be
superadded to the rights of sovereignty. Here are the
actual words of Chief-Justice Marshall:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is not intended to say that belligerent rights may not
be superadded to those of sovereignty. But admitting a
sovereign, who is endeavoring to reduce his revolted subjects
to obedience, to possess both sovereign and belligerent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>rights, and to be capable of acting in either character, the
manner in which he acts must determine the character of
the act. If as a legislator he publishes a law ordaining punishments
for certain offences, which law is to be applied by
courts, the nature of the law and of the proceedings under
it will decide whether it is an exercise of belligerent rights
or exclusively of his sovereign power.”<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Here are the words of another eminent judge, Mr.
Justice Johnson, in the same case:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“But there existed a war between the parent state and
her colony. It was not only a fact of the most universal
notoriety, but officially notified in the gazettes of the United
States.… Here, then, was notice of the existence of
war, and an assertion of the rights consequent upon it.
The object of the measure was … solely the reduction
of an enemy. <em>It was, therefore, not merely municipal, but
belligerent, in its nature and object.</em>”<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Although the conclusion of the Court in this case
was afterwards reversed, yet nothing occurred to modify
the judgment on the principles now in question;
so that the case remains authority for double proceedings,
municipal and belligerent.</p>

<p>On a similar state of facts, arising from the efforts
of France to suppress the insurrection in San Domingo,
the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania asserted the same
principle; and here we find the eminent Chief-Justice
Tilghman&mdash;one of the best authorities of the American
bench&mdash;giving to it the weight of his enlightened
judgment. These are his words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We are not at liberty to consider the island in any other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>light than as part of the dominions of the French Republic.
<em>But supposing it to be so, the Republic is possessed of belligerent
rights.…</em></p>

<p>“Although the French Government, from motives of
policy, might not choose to make mention of war, yet it
does not follow that it might not avail itself of all rights to
which by the Law of Nations it was entitled in the existing
circumstances.… This was the course pursued by
Great Britain in the Revolutionary War with the United
States.… Considering the words of the <i>arrêté</i>, and the
circumstances under which it was made, it ought not to be
understood simply as a municipal regulation, but a municipal
regulation connected with <em>a state of war</em> with revolted
subjects.”<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The principle embodied in these cases is accurately
stated by a recent text-writer as follows.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“A sovereign nation, engaged in the duty of suppressing
an insurrection of its citizens, may, with entire consistency,
act in the twofold capacity of sovereign and belligerent,
according to the several measures resorted to for the
accomplishment of its purpose. By inflicting, through its
agent, the judiciary, the penalty which the law affixes to the
capital crimes of treason and piracy, … it acts in its
capacity as a sovereign, and its courts are but enforcing its
municipal regulations. By instituting a blockade of the
ports of its rebellious subjects, … the nation is exercising
the right of a belligerent, and its courts, in their
adjudications upon the captures made in the enforcement
of this measure, are organized as Courts of Prize, governed
by and administering the Law of Nations.”<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The same principle has received most authentic declaration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
in the recent judgment of an able magistrate in a
case of Prize for a violation of the blockade. I refer to
the case of the <i>Amy Warwick</i>, tried in Boston, where
Judge Sprague, of the District Court, expressed himself
as follows.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The United States, as a nation, have full and complete
belligerent rights, which are in no degree impaired by the
fact that their enemies owe allegiance, and have superadded
the guilt of treason to that of unjust war.”<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Among all the judges called to consider judicially the
character of this Rebellion, I know of none whose opinion
is entitled to more consideration. Long experience
has increased his original aptitude for such questions,
and made him an authority.</p>

<p>There is an earlier voice, which, even if all judicial
tribunals had been silent, would be decisive. I refer to
Hugo Grotius, who, by his work “<i>De Jure Belli ac Pacis</i>,”
became the lawgiver of nations. Original in conception,
vast in plan, various in learning, and humane
in sentiment, this effort created the science of International
Law, which, since that early day, has been
softened and refined, without essential change in the
principles then enunciated. His master mind anticipated
the true distinction, when, in definition of War,
he wrote as follows.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The first and most necessary partition of war is this:
that war is <em>private</em>, <em>public</em>, or <em>mixed</em>. Public war is that
which is carried on under the authority of him who has
jurisdiction; private, that which is otherwise; <em>mixed, that
which is public on one side and private on the other</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>In these few words of this great authority is found
the very discrimination which enters into the present
discussion. The war in which we are now engaged is
not precisely “public,” because on one side there is
no Government; nor is it “private,” because on one
side there is a Government; but it is “mixed,”&mdash;that
is, public on one side and private on the other. On
the side of the United States, it is under authority of
the Government, and therefore “public”; on the other
side, it is without the sanction of any recognized
Government, and therefore “private.” In other words,
the Government of the United States may claim for
itself all belligerent rights, while it refuses them to
the other side. And Grotius, in his reasoning, sustains
his definition by showing that war becomes the essential
agency, where public justice ends,&mdash;that it is the
justifiable mode of dealing with those who are not kept
in order by judicial proceedings,&mdash;and that, as a natural
consequence, where war prevails, the Municipal Law is
silent. And here, with that largess of quotation which
is one of his peculiarities, he adduces the weighty words
of Demosthenes: “Against enemies, who cannot be coerced
by our laws, it is proper and necessary to maintain
armies, to send out fleets, and to pay taxes; but
against our own citizens, a decree, an indictment, the
state vessel are sufficient.”<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> But when citizens array
themselves in multitudes, they come within the declared
condition of enemies. There is so much intrinsic
reason in this distinction that I am ashamed to take
time upon it. And yet it has been constantly neglected
in this debate. Let it be accepted, and the constitutional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
scruples which play such a part will be out of
place.</p>

<p>Senators seem to feel the importance of being able to
treat the Rebels as “alien enemies,” on account of penalties
which would then attach. The Senator from Kentucky
[Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>], in his bill, proposes to declare them
so, and the Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. <span class="smcap">Doolittle</span>]
has made a similar proposition with regard to a particular
class. But all this is superfluous. Rebels in arms
are “enemies,” exposed to all the penalties of war, as
much as if they were alien enemies. No legislation is
required to make them so. They are so in fact. It
only remains that they should be treated so, or, according
to the Declaration of Independence, that we “hold
them, as we hold the rest of mankind, <em>enemies in war</em>,
in peace friends.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mark now the stages of the discussion. We have
seen, first, that, in point of <em>fact</em>, we are in the midst of
rebellion and in the midst of a war,&mdash;and, secondly,
that, in point of <em>law</em>, we are at liberty to act under powers
incident to either or both of these conditions, treat
the people engaged against us as criminals, or as enemies,
or, if we please, as both. Pardon me, if I repeat
these propositions; but it is essential that they should
not be forgotten.</p>

<p>Therefore, Sir, in determining our course, we may
banish all question of power. The power is ample
and indubitable, being regulated in the one case by the
Constitution, and in the other case by the Rights of
War. Treating them as criminals, then are we under
the restraints of the Constitution; treating them as
enemies, we have all the latitude sanctioned by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
Rights of War; treating them as both, then may we
combine our penalties from the double source. What
is done against them merely as <em>criminals</em> will naturally
be in conformity with the Constitution; but what is
done against them as <em>enemies</em> will have no limitation
except the Rights of War.</p>

<p>The difference between these two systems, represented
by two opposite propositions now pending, may be
seen in the motive which is the starting-point of each.
Treating those arrayed in arms against us as criminals,
we assume sovereignty, and seek to punish for violation
of existing law. Treating them as enemies, we assume
no sovereignty, but simply employ the means known to
war in overcoming an enemy, and in obtaining security
against him. In the one case our cause is founded in
Municipal Law under the Constitution, and in the
other case in the Rights of War under International
Law. In the one case our object is simply punishment;
in the other case it is assured victory.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Having determined the existence of these two sources
of power, we are next led to consider the character
and extent of each under the National Government:
first, <em>Rights against Criminals</em>, founded on sovereignty,
with their limitations under the Constitution; and, secondly,
<em>Rights against Enemies</em>, founded on war, which
are absolutely without constitutional limitation. Having
passed these in review, the way will then be open to
consider which class of rights Congress shall exercise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<h4>I.</h4>

<p>I begin, of course, with <em>Rights against Criminals</em>,
founded on sovereignty, with their limitations under
the Constitution.</p>

<p>Rebellion is in itself the crime of treason, which is
usually called the greatest crime known to the law,
containing all other crimes, as the greater contains the
less. But neither the magnitude of the crime nor the
detestation it inspires can properly move us from duty
to the Constitution. Howsoever important it may be
to punish rebels, this must not be done at the expense
of the Constitution. On that point I agree with the
Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. <span class="smcap">Cowan</span>], and the Senator
from Vermont [Mr. <span class="smcap">Collamer</span>]; nor will I yield
to either in determination to uphold the Constitution,
which is the shield of the citizen. Show me that any
proposition is without support in the Constitution, or
that it offends against any constitutional safeguard, and
it cannot receive my vote. Sir, I shall not allow Senators
to be more careful on this head than myself. They
shall not have a monopoly of this proper caution.</p>

<p>In proceedings against criminals there are provisions
or principles of the Constitution which cannot be disregarded.
I will enumerate them, and endeavor to explain
their true character.</p>

<p>1. Congress, it is said, has no power under the
Constitution over Slavery in the States. This popular
principle of Constitutional Law, which is without foundation
in the positive text of the Constitution, is adduced
against all propositions to free the slaves of
Rebels. But this is an obvious misapplication of the
alleged principle, which simply means that Congress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
has no direct power over Slavery in the States, so as to
abolish or limit it. For no careful person, whose opinion
is of any value, ever attributed to the pretended
property in slaves an immunity from forfeiture or confiscation
not accorded to other property; and this is a
complete answer to the argument on this head. Even
in prohibiting Slavery, as in the Jeffersonian ordinance,
there is a declared exception of the penalty of crime;
and so in upholding Slavery in the States, there must be
a tacit, but unquestionable, exception of this penalty.</p>

<p>2. There must be no <i>ex post facto</i> law; which means
that there can be no law against crime retrospective in
its effect. This is clear.</p>

<p>3. There must be no bill of attainder; which means
that there can be no special legislation, where Congress,
undertaking the double function of legislature and
judge, shall inflict the punishment of death without
conviction by due process of law. And there is authority
for assuming that this prohibition includes a
bill of pains and penalties, which is a milder form of
legislative attainder, where the punishment inflicted is
less than death.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> And surely no constitutional principle
is more worthy of recognition.</p>

<p>4. No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or
property, without due process of law; which means,
without presentment, or other judicial proceeding. This
provision, borrowed from Magna Charta, constitutes a
safeguard for all: nor can it be invoked by the criminal
more than by the slave; for in our Constitution
it is applicable to every “person,” without distinction
of condition or color. But the criminal is entitled to its
protection.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>
<p>5. In all criminal prosecutions the accused shall
enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an
impartial jury of the State and District wherein the
crime shall have been committed, which District shall
have been previously ascertained by law. This is the
sixth amendment to the Constitution, and is not to be
lost sight of now. The accused, whoever he may be,
though his guilt be open as noonday, can be reached
<em>criminally</em> only in the way described. When we consider
the deep and wide-spread prejudices which must
exist throughout the whole Rebel territory, it is difficult
to suppose that any jury could be found within
the State and District where the treason was committed
who would unite in the necessary verdict of Guilty.
For myself, I do not expect it; and I renounce the idea
of justice in this way. Jefferson Davis himself, whose
crime has culminated in Virginia, could not be convicted
by a jury of that State. But it is the duty of the
statesman to consider how justice, impossible in one
way, may be made possible in another way.</p>

<p>6. No attainder of treason shall work corruption of
blood, or forfeiture except during the life of the person
attainted. Perhaps no provision of the Constitution,
supposed pertinent to the present debate, has been
more considered; nor is there any with regard to which
there is greater difference of opinion. Learned lawyers
in this body insist broadly that it forbids forfeiture of
real estate, although not of personal, as a penalty of
treason; while others insist that all the real as well as
personal estate belonging to the offender may be forfeited.
The words of the Constitution are technical, so
as to require interpretation; and as they are derived
from the Common Law, we must look to this law for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
their meaning. By “attainder of treason” is meant
<em>judgment of death</em> for treason,&mdash;that is, the judgment
of court on conviction of treason. “Upon judgment of
death for treason or felony,” says Blackstone, “a man
shall be said to be attainted.”<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Such judgment, which
is, of course, a criminal proceeding, cannot, under our
Constitution, work corruption of blood; which means
that it cannot create obstruction or incapacity in the
blood to prevent an innocent heir from tracing title
through the criminal, as was cruelly done by the Common
Law.</p>

<p>Nor shall such attainder work “forfeiture except during
the life of the person attainted.” If there be any
question, it arises under these words, which, it will be
observed, are peculiarly technical. As the term “attainder”
is confined to “judgment of death,” this prohibition
is limited precisely to where that judgment is awarded;
so that, if the person is not adjudged to death, there is
nothing in the Constitution to forbid absolute forfeiture.
This conclusion is irresistible. If accepted, it
disposes of the objection in all cases where there is
no judgment of death.</p>

<p>Even where the traitor is adjudged to death, there is
good reason to doubt if his estate in fee-simple, which
is absolutely his own, and alienable at his mere pleasure,
may not be forfeited. It is admitted by Senators that
the words of the Constitution do not forbid the forfeiture
of the personal estate, which in the present days
of commerce is usually much larger than the real estate,
although to an unprofessional mind these words are as
applicable to one as to the other; so that a person attainted
of treason would forfeit all his personal estate, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
every name and nature, no matter what its amount,
even if he did not forfeit his real estate. But since an
estate in fee-simple belongs absolutely to the owner,
and is in all respects subject to his disposition, there
seems no reason for its exemption which is not equally
applicable to personal property. The claim of the
family is as strong in one case as in the other. And if
we take counsel of analogy, we find ourselves led in the
same direction. It is difficult to say, that, in a case of
treason, there can be any limitation to the amount of fine
imposed; so that in sweeping extent it may take from
the criminal all his estate, real and personal. And, secondly,
it is very clear that the prohibition in the Constitution,
whatever it be, is confined to “attainder of treason,”
and not, therefore, applicable to a judgment for
felony, which at the Common Law worked forfeiture of
all estate, real and personal; so that under the Constitution
such forfeiture for felony can be now maintained.
But assuming the Constitution applicable to treason
where there is no judgment of death, it is only reasonable
to suppose that this prohibition is applicable <em>exclusively
to that posthumous forfeiture depending upon corruption
of blood</em>; and here the rule is sustained by intrinsic
justice. But all present estate, real as well as
personal, actually belonging to the traitor, is forfeited.</p>

<p>Not doubting the intrinsic justice of this rule, I am
sustained by the authority of Mr. Hallam, who, in a
note to his invaluable History of Literature, after declaring,
that, according to the principle of Grotius, the
English law of forfeiture in high treason is just, being
part of the direct punishment of the guilty, but that
of attainder or corruption of blood is unjust, being an
infliction on the innocent alone, stops to say:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I incline to concur in this distinction, and think it at
least plausible, though it was seldom or never taken in the
discussions concerning those two laws. Confiscation is no
more unjust towards the posterity of an offender than fine,
from which, of course, it only differs in degree.”<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

</div>

<p>An opinion from such an authority is entitled to much
weight in determining the proper signification of doubtful
words.</p>

<p>This interpretation is helped by another suggestion,
which supposes the comma in the text of the Constitution
misplaced, and that, instead of being after “corruption
of blood,” it should be after “forfeiture,” separating
it from the words “except during the life of the person
attainted,” and making them refer to the time when the
attainder takes place, rather than to the length of time
for which the estate is forfeited. Thus does this much
debated clause simply operate to forbid forfeiture when
not pronounced “during the life of the person attainted.”
In other words, the forfeiture cannot be pronounced
against a dead man, or the children of a dead man, and
this is all.</p>

<p>Amidst the confusion in which this clause is involved,
you cannot expect that it will be a strong restraint upon
any exercise of power under the Constitution which
otherwise seems rational and just. But, whatever its
signification, it has no bearing on our rights against
enemies. Bear this in mind. Criminals only, and not
enemies, can take advantage of it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such, Mr. President, are the provisions or principles
of Constitutional Law controlling us in the exercise of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
rights against criminals. If any bill or proposition,
penal in character, having for its object simply punishment,
and ancillary to the administration of justice,
violates any of these safeguards, it is not constitutional.
Therefore do I admit that the bill of the Committee, and
every other bill now before the Senate, so far as they
assume to exercise the Rights of Sovereignty in contradistinction
to the Rights of War, must be in conformity
with these provisions or principles.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But the Senator from Vermont [Mr. <span class="smcap">Collamer</span>], in
his ingenious speech, to which we all listened with so
much interest, was truly festive in allusion to certain
proceedings much discussed in this debate. The Senator
did not like proceedings <i>in rem</i>, although I do not
know that he positively objected to them as unconstitutional.
It is difficult to imagine any such objection.
Assuming that criminals cannot be reached to be
punished <em>personally</em>, or that they have fled, the Senator
from Illinois [Mr. <span class="smcap">Trumbull</span>], and also the Senator from
New York [Mr. <span class="smcap">Harris</span>], propose to reach them through
their property,&mdash;or, adopting technical language, instead
of proceedings <i>in personam</i>, which must fail from
want of jurisdiction, propose proceedings <i>in rem</i>. Such
proceedings may not be of familiar resort, since, happily,
an occasion like the present has never before occurred
among us; but they are strictly in conformity with established
precedents, and also with the principles by
which these precedents are sustained.</p>

<p>Nobody can forget that smuggled goods are liable
to confiscation by proceedings <i>in rem</i>. This is a familiar
instance. The calendar of our District Courts is
crowded with these cases, where the United States are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
plaintiff, and some inanimate thing, an article of property,
is defendant. Such, also, are proceedings against
a ship engaged in the slave-trade. Of course, by principles
of the Common Law, a conviction is necessary to
divest the offender’s title; but this rule is never applied
to forfeitures created by statute. It is clear that the
same sovereignty which creates the forfeiture may determine
the proceedings by which it shall be ascertained.
If, therefore, it be constitutional to direct the
forfeiture of rebel property, it is constitutional to authorize
proceedings <i>in rem</i> against it, according to established
practice. Such proceedings constitute “due process
of law,” well known in our courts, familiar to the
English Exchequer, and having the sanction of the
ancient Roman jurisprudence. If any authority were
needed for this statement, it is found in the judgment
of the Supreme Court of the United States in the case
of the <i>Palmyra</i>, where it is said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Many cases exist where there is both a forfeiture <i>in rem</i>
and a personal penalty. But in neither class of cases has
it ever been decided that the prosecutions were dependent
upon each other; but the practice has been, and so this Court
understand the law to be, that the proceeding <i>in rem</i> stands
independent of, and wholly unaffected by, any criminal proceeding
<i>in personam</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The reason for proceedings <i>in rem</i> is, doubtless, that
<em>the thing</em> is in a certain sense an offender, or at least has
coöperated with the offender,&mdash;as a ship in the slave-trade.
But the same reason prevails, although perhaps
to less extent, in proceedings against rebel property,
which, if not an offender, has at least coöperated with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
the offender hardly less than the ship in the slave-trade.
Through his property the traitor is enabled to devote
himself to treason, and to follow its accursed trade, waging
war against his country; so that his property may
be considered guilty also. But the condemnation of the
property cannot be a bar to proceedings against the traitor
himself, should he fall within our power. The two
are distinct, although identical in their primary object,
which is punishment.</p>

<p>Pardon me, Sir, if, dwelling on these things, I feel
humbled that the course of the debate imposes such
necessity. Standing, as we do, face to face with enemies
striking at the life of the Republic, it is painful
to find ourselves subjected to all the embarrassments of
a criminal proceeding, as if this war were an indictment,
and the army and navy of the United States, now mustered
on land and sea, were only a <i>posse comitatus</i>. It
should not be so. The Rebels have gone outside of
the Constitution to make war upon their country. It
is for us to pursue them as enemies outside of the Constitution,
where they wickedly place themselves, and
where the Constitution concurs in placing them also.
So doing, we simply obey the Constitution, and act in
all respects constitutionally.</p>

<h4>II.</h4>

<p>And this brings me to the second chief head of inquiry,
not less important than the first: <em>What are the
Rights against Enemies which Congress may exercise in
War?</em></p>

<p>Clearly the United States may exercise all the Rights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
of War which according to International Law belong
to independent states. In affirming this proposition, I
waive for the present all question whether these rights
are to be exercised by Congress or by the President. It
is sufficient that every nation has in this respect perfect
equality; nor can any Rights of War accorded to
other nations be denied to the United States. Harsh
and repulsive as these rights unquestionably are, they
are derived from the overruling, instinctive laws of self-defence,
common to nations as to individuals. Every
community having the form and character of sovereignty
has a right to national life, and in defence of such life
may put forth all its energies. Any other principle
would leave it the wretched prey of wicked men, abroad
or at home. In vain you accord the rights of sovereignty,
if you despoil it of other rights without which
sovereignty is only a name. “I think, therefore I am,”
was the sententious utterance by which the first of
modern philosophers demonstrated personal existence.
“I am, therefore I have rights,” is the declaration of
every sovereignty, when its existence is assailed.</p>

<p>Pardon me, if I interpose again to remind you of the
essential difference between these rights and those others
just considered. Though incident to sovereignty,
they are not to be confounded with those peaceful
rights which are all exhausted in a penal statute within
the limitations of the Constitution. The difference
between a judge and a general, between the halter of
the executioner and the sword of the soldier, between
the open palm and the clenched fist, is not greater
than that between these two classes of rights. They
are different in origin, different in extent, and different
in object.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>I rejoice to believe that civilization has already done
much to mitigate the Rights of War; and it is among
long cherished visions, which present events cannot
make me renounce, that the time is coming when all
these rights will be further softened to the mood of
permanent peace. Though in the lapse of generations
changed in many things, especially as regards non-combatants
and private property on land, these rights still
exist under the sanction of the Law of Nations, to be
claimed whenever war prevails. It is absurd to accord
the right to do a thing without according the means
necessary to the end. And since war, which is nothing
less than organized force, is permitted, all the means
to its effective prosecution are permitted also, tempered
always by that humanity which strengthens while it
charms.</p>

<p>I begin this inquiry by putting aside all Rights of
War against persons. In battle, persons are slain or
captured, and, if captured, detained as prisoners till the
close of the war, unless previously released by exchange
or clemency. But these rights do not enter into the
present discussion, which concerns property only, and
not persons. From the nature of the case, it is only
against property, or what is claimed as such, that confiscation
is directed. Therefore I say nothing of persons,
nor shall I consider any question of personal
rights. According to the Rights of War, property, although
inanimate, shares the guilt of its owner. Like
him, it is criminal, and may be prosecuted to condemnation
in tribunals constituted for the purpose, without
any of those immunities claimed by persons accused of
crime. It is <em>Rights of War against the property of an
enemy</em> which I now consider.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>If we resort to the earlier authorities, not excepting
Grotius himself, we find these rights stated most austerely.
I shall not go back to any such statement, but
content myself with one of later date. You may find
it harsh; but here it is.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Since this is the very condition of war, that enemies
are despoiled of all right and proscribed, it stands to reason
that whatever property of an enemy is found in his enemy’s
country changes its owner and goes to the treasury.
It is customary, moreover, in almost every declaration
of war, to ordain that goods of the enemy, as well those
found among us as those taken in war, be confiscated.…
Pursuant to the mere Right of War, even immovables could
be sold and their price turned into the treasury, as is the
practice in regard to movables; but throughout almost all
Europe only a register is made of immovables, in order that
during the war the treasury may receive their rents and
profits, but at the termination of the war the immovables
themselves are by treaty restored to the former owners.”<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

</div>

<p>These are the words of the eminent Dutch publicist,
Bynkershoek, in the first half of the last century. In
adducing them now I present them as adopted by Mr.
Jefferson, in his remarkable answer to the note of the
British minister at Philadelphia on the confiscations of
the American Revolution. There are no words of greater
weight in any writer on the Law of Nations. But
Mr. Jefferson did not content himself with quotation.
In the same state paper he thus declares unquestionable
rights:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It cannot be denied that the state of war strictly permits
a nation to seize the property of its enemies <em>found within its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>own limits or taken in war</em>, and in whatever form it exists,
whether in action or possession.”<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This sententious statement is under date of 1792,
and, when we consider the circumstances which called
it forth, may be accepted as American doctrine. But
even in our own day, since the beginning of the present
war, the same principle has been stated yet more sententiously
in another quarter. The Lord Advocate of
Scotland, in the British House of Commons, as late as
17th March of the present year, declared:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The honorable gentleman spoke as if it was no principle
of war that private rights should suffer at the hands of the
adverse belligerent. But that was the true principle of war.
If war was not to be defined&mdash;as it very nearly might be&mdash;as
a denial of the rights of private property to the enemy,
that denial was certainly one of the essential ingredients
in it.”<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In quoting these authorities, which are general in
their bearing, I do not stop to consider their modification
according to the discretion of the belligerent power.
I accept them as the starting-point in the present inquiry,
and assume that by the Rights of War enemy
property may be taken. But rights with regard to such
property are modified by the <em>locality</em> of the property;
and this consideration makes it proper to consider them
under two heads: <i>first</i>, rights with regard to enemy
property actually within the national jurisdiction; and,
<i>secondly</i>, rights with regard to enemy property actually
outside the national jurisdiction. It is easy to see, that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
in the present war, rights against enemy property actually
outside the national jurisdiction must exist <i>a fortiori</i>
against such property actually within the jurisdiction.
But, for the sake of clearness, I shall speak of
them separately.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>First.</i> I begin with the Rights of War over enemy
property actually within the national jurisdiction. In
stating the general rule, I adopt the language of a recent
English authority.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Although there have been so many conventions granting
exemption from the liabilities resulting from a state of war,
the right to seize the property of enemies found in our territory
when war breaks out remains indisputable, according to
the Law of Nations, wherever there is no such special convention.
All jurists, including the most recent, such as De
Martens and Klüber, agree in this decision.”<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This statement is general, but unquestionable even
in its rigor. For the sake of clearness and accuracy it
must be considered in its application to different kinds
of property.</p>

<p>1. It is undeniable, that, in generality, the rule must
embrace real property, or, as termed by the Roman Law
and the Continental systems of jurisprudence, <em>immovables</em>;
but so important an authority as Vattel excepts
this species of property, for the reason, that, being acquired
by consent of the sovereign, it is as if it belonged
to his own subjects.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> But personal property is also
under the same safeguard, and yet it is not embraced
within the exception. If such, indeed, be the reason for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
the exception of real property, <em>it loses all applicability
where the property belongs to an enemy who began by
breaking faith on his side</em>. Surely, whatever the immunity
of an ordinary enemy, it is difficult to see how
a rebel enemy, whose hostility is bad faith in arms, can
plead any safeguard. <i>Cessante ratione, cessat et ipsa lex</i>,
is an approved maxim of the law; and since with us the
reason of Vattel does not exist, the exception which he
propounds need not be recognized, to the disparagement
of the general rule.</p>

<p>2. The rule is necessarily applicable to all personal
property, or, as it is otherwise called, <em>movables</em>. On this
head there is hardly a dissenting voice, while the Supreme
Court of the United States, in a case constantly
cited in this debate, has solemnly affirmed it. I refer
to <i>Brown</i> v. <i>United States</i>,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> where the broad principle is
assumed that war gives to the sovereign full right to
confiscate the property of the enemy, wherever found,
and that the mitigations of the rule, derived from modern
civilization, may affect the exercise of the right, but
cannot impair the right itself. Goods of the enemy
actually in the country, and all vessels and cargoes
afloat in our ports, at the commencement of hostilities,
were declared liable to confiscation. In England, it is
the constant usage, under the name of “Droits of Admiralty,”
to seize and condemn property of an enemy in its
ports at the breaking out of hostilities.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> But this was
not followed in the Crimean War, although the claim
itself has never been abandoned.</p>

<p>3. The rule, in strictness, also embraces private debts
due to an enemy. Although justly obnoxious to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
charge of harshness, and uncongenial with an age of
universal commerce, this application is recognized by
the judicial authorities of the United States. Between
debts contracted under faith of laws and property acquired
under faith of the same laws reason draws no
distinction; and the right of the sovereign to confiscate
debts is precisely the same with the right to confiscate
other property within the country on the breaking out
of war. Both, it is said, require some special act expressing
the sovereign will, and both depend less on
any flexible rule of International Law than on paramount
political considerations, which International Law
will not control. Of course, just so far as slaves are
regarded as property, or as bound to service or labor,
they cannot constitute an exception to this rule, while
the political considerations entering so largely into its
application have with regard to them commanding force.
In their case, by natural metamorphosis, confiscation
becomes emancipation.</p>

<p>Such are recognized Rights of War touching enemy
property within the national jurisdiction.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Secondly.</i> The same broad rule with which I began
may be stated touching enemy property beyond the
national jurisdiction, subject, of course, to mitigation
from usage, policy, and humanity, but still existing, to
be employed in the discretion of the belligerent power.
It may be illustrated by different classes of cases.</p>

<p>1. Public property of all kinds belonging to an enemy,&mdash;that
is, property of the government or prince,&mdash;including
lands, forests, fortresses, munitions of war,
movables,&mdash;is all subject to seizure and appropriation
by the conqueror, who may transfer the same by valid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
title, substituting himself, in this respect, for the displaced
government or prince. It is obvious that in the
case of immovables the title is finally assured only by
the establishment of peace, while in the case of movables
it is complete from the moment the property
comes within the firm possession of the captor so as
to be alienated indefeasibly. In harmony with the military
prepossessions of ancient Rome, such title was
considered the best to be had, and its symbol was a
spear.</p>

<p>2. Private property of an enemy at sea, or afloat in
port, is indiscriminately liable to capture and confiscation;
but the title is assured only by condemnation in
a competent court of prize.</p>

<p>3. While private property of an enemy on land, according
to modern practice, is exempt from seizure simply
as private property, yet it is exposed to seizure in
certain specified cases. Indeed, it is more correct to
say, with the excellent Manning, that it “is still considered
as liable to seizure,” under circumstances constituting
in themselves a necessity, of which the conqueror
is judge.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> It need not be added that this extraordinary
power must be so used as not to assume the character
of spoliation. It must have an object essential to the
conduct of the war. But, with such object, it cannot be
questioned. The obvious reason for exemption is, that
a private individual is not personally responsible, as the
government or prince. <em>But every rebel is personally responsible.</em></p>

<p>4. Private property of an enemy on land may be
taken as a penalty for the illegal acts of individuals,
or of the community to which they belong. The exercise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
of this right is vindicated only by peculiar circumstances;
but it is clearly among the recognized agencies
of war, and it is easy to imagine that at times it may
be important, especially in dealing with a dishonest rebellion.</p>

<p>5. Private property of an enemy on land may be
taken for contributions to support the war. This has
been done in times past on a large scale. Napoleon
adopted the rule that war should support itself. Upon
the invasion of Mexico by the armies of the United
States, in 1846, the commanding generals were at first
instructed to abstain from taking private property without
purchase at a fair price; but subsequent instructions
were of a severer character. It was declared by Mr. Marcy,
at the time Secretary of War, that an invading army
had the unquestionable right to draw supplies from the
enemy without paying for them, and to require contributions
for its support, and to make the enemy feel the
weight of the war.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Such contributions are sometimes
called “requisitions,” and a German writer on the Law
of Nations says that it was Washington who “invented
the expression and the thing.”<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Possibly the expression;
but the thing is as old as war.</p>

<p>6. Private property of an enemy on land may be
taken on the field of battle, in operations of siege, or
the storming of a place refusing to capitulate. This
passes under the offensive name of “booty” or “loot.”
In the late capture of the imperial palace of Pekin by
the allied forces of France and England, this right was
illustrated by the surrender of its contents, including<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
silks, porcelain, and furniture, to the lawless cupidity
of an excited soldiery.</p>

<p>7. Pretended property of an enemy in slaves may
unquestionably be taken, and, when taken, will of
course be at the disposal of the captor. If slaves are
regarded as property, then will their confiscation come
precisely within the rule already stated. But, since
slaves are men, there is still another rule of public law
applicable to them. It is clear, that, where there is an
intestine division in an enemy country, we may take
advantage of it, according to Halleck, in his recent work
on International Law, “without scruple.”<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> But Slavery
is more than an intestine division; it is a constant state
of war. The ancient Scythians said to Alexander: “Between
the master and slave no friendship exists; even
in peace the Rights of War are still preserved.”<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Giving
freedom to slaves, a nation in war simply takes
advantage of the actual condition of things. But there
is another vindication of this right, which I prefer to
present in the language of Vattel. After declaring that
“in conscience and by the laws of equity” we may be
obliged to restore “booty” recovered from an enemy
who had taken it in unjust war, this humane publicist
proceeds as follows.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The obligation is more certain and more extensive with
regard to a people whom our enemy has unjustly oppressed.
For a people thus spoiled of their liberty never renounce the
hope of recovering it. If they have not voluntarily incorporated
themselves with the state by which they have been
subdued, if they have not freely aided her in the war against
us, <em>we ought certainly so to use our victory as not merely to give
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>them a new master, but to break their chains</em>. To deliver an
oppressed people is a noble fruit of victory; it is a valuable
advantage gained thus to acquire a faithful friend.”<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

</div>

<p>These are not the words of a visionary, or of a speculator,
or of an agitator, but of a publicist, an acknowledged
authority on the Law of Nations.</p>

<p>Therefore, according to the Rights of War, slaves, if
regarded as property, may be declared free; or if regarded
as men, they may be declared free, under two
acknowledged rules: <i>first</i>, of self-interest, to procure an
ally; and, <i>secondly</i>, of conscience and equity, to do an
act of justice ennobling victory.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such, Sir, are acknowledged Rights of War with
regard to enemy property, whether within or beyond
our territorial jurisdiction. I do little more than state
these rights, without stopping to comment. If they
seem harsh, it is because war in essential character is
harsh. It is sufficient for our present purpose that
they exist.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Of course, all these rights belong to the United States.
There is not one of them which can be denied. They
are ours under that great title of Independence by
which our place was assured in the Family of Nations.
Dormant in peace, they are aroused into activity only
by the breath of war, when they all place themselves at
our bidding, to be employed at our own time, in our
own way, and according to our own discretion, subject
only to that enlightened public opinion which now rules
the civilized world.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>
<p>Belonging to the United States by virtue of International
Law, and being essential to self-defence, they are
naturally deposited with the <em>supreme power</em>, which holds
the issues of peace and war. Doubtless there are Rights
of War, embracing confiscation, contribution, and liberation,
to be exercised by any commanding general in
the field, or to be ordered by the President, according to
the exigency. Mr. Marcy was not ignorant of his duty,
when, by instructions from Washington, in the name of
the President, he directed the levy of contributions in
Mexico. In European countries all these Rights of War
which I have reviewed to-day are deposited with the
executive alone,&mdash;as in England with the Queen in
Council, and in France and Russia with the Emperor;
but in the United States they are deposited with the
legislative branch, being the President, Senate, and
House of Representatives, whose joint action becomes
the supreme law of the land. The Constitution is not
silent on this question. It expressly provides that
Congress shall have power, first, “to declare war,” and
thus set in motion all the Rights of War; secondly, “to
grant letters of marque and reprisal,” being two special
agencies of war; thirdly, “to make rules concerning
captures on land and water,” which power of itself embraces
the whole field of confiscation, contribution, and
liberation; fourthly, “to raise and support armies,” which
power, of course, comprehends all means for this purpose
known to the Rights of War; fifthly, “to provide and
maintain a navy,” plainly according to the Rights of
War; sixthly, “to make rules for the government and
regulation of the land and naval forces,” another power
involving confiscation, contribution, and liberation; and,
seventhly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> “to provide for calling forth the militia to
execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections,
and repel invasions,” a power which again sets in motion
all the Rights of War. But, as if to leave nothing undone,
the Constitution further empowers Congress “to
make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for
carrying into execution the foregoing powers.” In pursuance
of these powers, Congress has already enacted upwards
of one hundred articles of war for the government
of the army, one of which provides for the security of
public stores taken from the enemy. It has also sanctioned
the blockade of the Rebel ports according to International
Law. And only at the present session we have
enacted an additional article to regulate the conduct of
officers and men towards slaves seeking shelter in camp.
Proceeding further on the present occasion, it will act
in harmony with its own precedents, as well as with its
declared powers, according to the very words of the
Constitution. Language cannot be broader. Under its
comprehensive scope there is nothing essential to the
prosecution of the war, its conduct, its support, or its
success,&mdash;yes, Sir, there can be nothing essential to its
success, which is not positively within the province of
Congress. There is not one of the Rights of War which
Congress may not invoke. There is not a single weapon
in its terrible arsenal which Congress may not grasp.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such are indubitable powers of Congress. It is not
questioned that these may all be employed against a public
enemy; but there are Senators who strangely hesitate
to employ them against that worst enemy of all,
who to hostility adds treason, and teaches his country</p>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>The rebel in arms is an enemy, and something more;
nor is there any Right of War which may not be employed
against him in its extremest rigor. In appealing
to war, he has voluntarily renounced all safeguards of the
Constitution, and put himself beyond its pale. In ranging
himself among enemies, he has broken faith so as to
lose completely all immunity from the strictest penalties
of war. As an enemy, he must be encountered; nor can
our army be delayed in the exercise of the Rights of
War by any misapplied questions of <i>ex post facto</i>, bills
of attainder, attainder of treason, due process of law, or
exemption from forfeiture. If we may shoot rebel enemies
in battle, if we may shut them up in fortresses or
prisons, if we may bombard their forts, if we may occupy
their fields, if we may appropriate their crops, if we may
blockade their ports, if we may seize their vessels, if we
may capture their cities, it is vain to say that we may
not exercise against them the other associate prerogatives
of war. Nor can any technical question of constitutional
rights be interposed in one case more than
another. Every prerogative of confiscation, requisition,
or liberation known in war may be exercised against
rebels in arms precisely as against public enemies.
Ours are belligerent rights to the fullest extent.</p>

<p>Sir, the case is strong. The Rebels are not only criminals,
they are also enemies, whose property is actually
within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States;
so that, according to the Supreme Court, it only remains
for Congress to declare the Rights of War to be exercised
against them. The case of Brown,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> so often cited
in this debate, affirms that enemy property actually
within our territorial jurisdiction can be seized only by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
virtue of an Act of Congress, and recognizes the complete
liability of all such property, when actually within such
territorial jurisdiction. It is therefore, in all respects, a
binding authority, precisely applicable; so that Senators
who would impair its force must deny either that the
Rebels are enemies or that their property is actually
within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.
Assuming that they are enemies, and that their property
is actually within our territorial jurisdiction, the power
of Congress is complete; and it is not to be confounded
with that of a commanding general in the field, or of the
President as commander-in-chief of the armies.</p>

<p>Pardon me, if I dwell on one point with regard to the
property of rebels in arms by which it is distinguishable
from the private property of enemies in international
war. <em>Every rebel in arms is directly responsible
for his conduct</em>, as in international war the government
or prince is directly responsible; so that on principle
he can claim no exemption from any penalty of war.
And since Public Law is founded on reason, it follows
that the rule subjecting to seizure and forfeiture all
property, real as well as personal, of the hostile government
or prince should be applied to all property,
real and personal, of the rebel in arms. It is impossible
for him to claim the immunity conceded generally
to private property of an enemy in international
war, and also conceded generally to land of an enemy
within our territorial jurisdiction. For the rebel in
arms there is no just exemption.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When claiming these powers for Congress, it must
also be stated that there is a limitation of time with
regard to their exercise. Whatever is done against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
Rebels in our character as belligerents under the Rights
of War must be done during war, and not after its close.
Naturally the Rights of War end with the war, except
in those consequences which have become fixed during
the war. With the establishment of peace the Rights of
Peace resume sway, and all proceedings are according to
the prescribed forms of the Constitution. Instead of laws
silenced by arms, there are arms submissive to laws.
Instead of courts martial or military proceedings, there
are the ordinary courts of justice with all constitutional
safeguards. If this change needed illustration, it would
be found in a memorable passage of French history.
Marshal Ney, who had deserted Louis the Eighteenth
to welcome Napoleon from Elba, was, after the capitulation
of Paris, handed over to a council of war for trial;
but the council, composed of marshals of France, declared
itself incompetent, since the case involved treason,
and the accused was carried before the Chamber
of Peers, of which he was a member, according
to the requirements of the French Charter. His condemnation
and execution have been indignantly criticized,
but the form of trial was a homage to the pacification
which had been proclaimed. Therefore let it be
borne in mind that all proceedings founded on the
Rights of War will expire, when the Constitution is
again established throughout the country. They are
temporary and incidental, in order to secure that blessed
peace which we all seek.</p>

<p>So completely are these rights distinguished from ordinary
municipal proceedings against crime, that they
are administered by tribunals constituted for the purpose,
with well-known proceedings of their own. Courts
of Prize have a fixed place in the judicial system of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
United States, and their jurisdiction excludes that of
municipal tribunals, so that no action can be brought in
a court of Common Law on account of a seizure <i>jure belli</i>.
It is their province to hear all cases of prize or capture,&mdash;in
short, every case of property arising under the Rights
of War; and although practically these cases are chiefly
maritime, yet the jurisdiction of such courts is held to
embrace hostile seizures on shore.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> The hearing is by
the court alone, without a jury, substantially according
to forms derived from the Roman Law; and the ordinary
judgment is against the thing captured, or <i>in rem</i>, pronouncing
its condemnation and distribution. In every
case of prize or capture, involving a question of property,
and not of crime, these proceedings constitute “due
process of law,” so as to be completely effective under
the Constitution, and, according to acknowledged principles,
they supersede the jurisdiction of all mere municipal
tribunals.</p>

<p>Among the few cases illustrating this exclusive jurisdiction
in matters of capture and prize on land is one
which arose from the exercise of military power in a
conquered province in India, and was at last considered
and decided by the Privy Council in England, after
most elaborate argument by the most eminent barristers
of the time. The facts are few. Upon the conquest
of Poonah, in 1817, Mr. Mountstuart Elphinstone,
perhaps the most finished man, and of completest gentleness,
who ever exercised power in British India, was
appointed “sole commissioner for the settlement of the
territory conquered, with authority over all the civil and
military officers employed in it.” In the discharge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
his dictatorial functions, he proceeded to appoint a “provisional
collector and magistrate of the city of Poonah
and the adjacent country,” whom he instructed “to deprive
the enemy of his resources, and in this and all
other points to make everything subservient to the
conduct of the war.” After indicating certain crimes
to be treated with summary punishment, he proceeded
to confer plenary powers, saying: “All other crimes
you will investigate according to the forms of justice
usual in the country, modified as you may think expedient;
and in all cases you will endeavor to enforce
the existing laws and customs, <em>unless where they are
clearly repugnant to reason and natural equity</em>.” Under
these instructions the provisional collector seized several
bags of gold, in the house of a prominent enemy.
In an action before the Supreme Court of Bombay for
the value of this treasure, and of a quantity of jewels
and shawls taken by the military, judgment was given
for the claimant. But this was overruled by the Court
of Appeals in England, on the ground, that, in the actual
state of warfare at that time, there was no jurisdiction
over a question of prize and capture in an ordinary
municipal court. At the bar it was argued:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“No country can ever be thoroughly brought under subjection,
if it is to be held, that, where there has been a conquest
and no capitulation, the mere publication of a proclamation,
desiring the people to be quiet, and telling them
what means would be resorted to, if they were not so, so far
reduces the country under the civil rule, that the army loses
its control, and the municipal courts acquire altogether jurisdiction,
so that every action of the officers in the direction
of military affairs is liable to their cognizance.”<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>
<p>In giving judgment, Lord Tenterden, at the time
Chief Justice of England, stated the conclusion, as
follows.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We think the proper character of the transaction was
that of <em>hostile seizure</em>, made, if not <i>flagrante</i>, yet <i>nondum
cessante bello</i>, regard being had both to the time, the place,
and the person, and consequently that the municipal court
had no jurisdiction to adjudge upon the subject, but that, if
anything was done amiss, recourse could only be had to the
Government for redress.”<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This is an important and leading authority, interesting
in all respects; but I adduce it now only to show
that municipal courts cannot properly take cognizance
of questions of property arising under the Rights of
War. This established principle testifies to the essential
difference between <em>rights against criminals</em> and
<em>rights against enemies</em>. There is a different tribunal for
each claim.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I have said what I have to say on the law of this
matter, bringing it to the standard of the Constitution
and of International Law, and I have exhibited the
powers of Congress in their two fountains. It is for
you to determine out of which you will draw, or, indeed,
if you will not draw from both. Regarding the
Rebels as criminals, you may so pursue and punish them.
Regarding them as enemies, you may blast them with
that summary vengeance which is among the dread
agencies of war, while, by an act of beneficent justice,
you elevate a race, and change this national calamity
into a sacred triumph. Or, regarding them both as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
criminals and as enemies, you may marshal against
them all the double penalties of rebellion and war,
or, better still, the penalties of rebellion and the triumphs
of war.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It now remains to borrow such instruction as we can
from the <em>history</em> of kindred measures. And here I am
not tempted to depart from that frankness which is
with me an instinct and a study. If there be anything
in the past to serve as warning, I shall not keep it back,
although I ask you to consider carefully the true value
of these instances, and how far they are a lesson to us.
If there be any course to which I incline, it will be
abandoned at once, when shown not to be for the highest
good. I have no theories to maintain at the expense
of my country or of truth.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Confiscation is hardly less ancient than national life.
It began with history. It appears in the Scriptures,
where Ahab took the vineyard of Naboth, and David
gave away the goods of a confederate of Absalom. The
Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. <span class="smcap">Doolittle</span>] reminded us
that it prevailed among the Persians and Macedonians.
In the better days of the Roman Republic it was little
known; but it appeared with the vengeful proscriptions
of Sylla; and Cæsar himself, always forbearing, yet,
while striving to mitigate the penalties of the Catilinarian
conspirators, moved a confiscation of all their property
to the public treasury. It flourished under the
Emperors, who made it alternately the instrument of
tyranny and of cupidity. But there were virtuous Emperors,
like Antoninus Pius, under whom the goods of a
convict were abandoned to his children, and like Trajan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
under whom confiscation was unknown. Among the
reforms of Justinian, in his immortal revision of the
law, this penalty disappeared, except in cases of treason.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
But these instances illustrate confiscation only
as punishment. Throughout Roman history it had been
inseparable from war. The auction was an incident of
the camp. It was a distribution of bounty lands among
the soldiers of Octavius, after the establishment of his
power, that drove Virgil from his paternal acres to seek
imperial favor at Rome.</p>

<p>In modern times confiscation became a constant instrument
of government, both in punishment and in
war. It was an essential incident to the feudal system,
which was in itself a form of government. Ruthlessly
exercised, sometimes against individuals and sometimes
against whole classes, it was converted into an engine
of vengeance and robbery, which spared neither genius
nor numbers. In Florence it was directed against
Dante, and in Holland against Grotius, while in early
England it was the power by which William of Normandy
despoiled the Saxons of their lands and parcelled
them among his followers. In Germany, during the period
of theological conflict which darkened that great
country, it was often used against Protestants, and was
at one time menaced on a gigantic scale. The Papal
Nuncio sought nothing less than the confiscation of all
the goods of heretics. Spain was not less intolerant
than Germany, and the story of the Moors and the
Jews, stripped of their possessions and sent forth as
wanderers, protests against such injustice. In early
France confiscation was not idle, although in one instance
it received an application which modern criticism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
will not reject, when, by special ordinance, <em>rebels</em> were
declared to be <em>enemies</em>, and their property was subjected
to confiscation as Prize of War.</p>

<p>By the law of England, it was the inseparable incident
of treason, flourishing always in Ireland, where rebellion
was chronic, and showing itself in Great Britain
whenever rebellion occurred. But it was simply
as part of punishment, precisely as the traitor was
drawn and quartered and his blood corrupted, all according
to law. The scaffold turned over to the Government
all the estate of its victims. But there is another
instance in English history entirely different in
character, where Henry the Eighth, in warfare with the
Catholic Church, did not hesitate to despoil the monasteries
of their great possessions, with a clear annual
revenue of one hundred and thirty-one thousand six
hundred and seven pounds, or, according to Bishop Burnet,
ten times that sum “in true value.”<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> This property,
so enormous in those days, wrested at once from
the mortmain of the Church, testifies to the boldness, if
not the policy, with which the power was wielded.</p>

<p>It is in modern France that confiscation has played
its greatest part, and been the most formidable weapon,
whether of punishment or of war. At first abolished
by the Revolution, as a relic of royal oppression, it was
at length adopted by the Revolution. Amidst the dangers
menacing the country, this sacrifice was pronounced
essential to save it, and successive laws were passed,
beginning as early as November, 1789, by which it was
authorized. Never before in history was confiscation so
sweeping. It aroused at the time the eloquent indignation
of Burke, and still causes a sigh among all who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
think less of principles than of privileges. From an
official report to the First Consul, it appears that before
1801 sales were authorized by the Government
to the fabulous amount of two thousand five hundred
and fifty-five millions of francs, or above five hundred
millions of dollars, while still a large mass, estimated
at seven hundred million francs, of confiscated property
remained unsold.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> The whole vast possessions of the
Church disappeared in this chasm.</p>

<p>Cruel as were many of the consequences, this confiscation
must be judged as part of the Revolution whose
temper it shared; nor is it easy to condemn anything
but its excesses, unless you are ready to say that the
safety of France, torn by domestic foes and invaded
from abroad, was not worth securing, or that equality
before the law, which is now the most assured possession
of that great nation, was not worth obtaining. It
was part of the broad scheme of Napoleon, moved by
politic generosity, to mitigate as far as possible the
operation of this promiscuous spoliation, especially by
restraining it, according to the principle of the bill
which I have introduced, to the most obnoxious persons,&mdash;although
this sharp ruler knew too well what
was due to titles once fixed by Government to contemplate
any restoration of landed property already alienated.
“There are,” he exclaimed, in the Council of State,
“above one hundred thousand names on these unhappy
lists: it is enough to turn one’s head.… <em>The list must
be reduced by three fourths of its number, to the names
of such as are known to be hostile to the Government.</em>”<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
Hostility to the Government constituted with him sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
reason for continued denial of all rights of property
or citizenship. And so jealous was he on this point,
that, when he heard that some who were allowed to
enter upon their yet unalienated lands had proceeded
to cut down the forests, partly from necessity and
partly to transfer funds abroad, he interfered peremptorily,
in words applicable to our present condition:
“We cannot allow the greatest enemies of the Republic,
the defenders of old prejudices, to recover their fortunes
and despoil France.”<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> This episode of history, so suggestive
to us, will not be complete, if I do not mention,
that, through this policy of confiscation, France passed
from the hands of dominant proprietors, with extended
possessions, into the hands of those small farmers now
constituting so important a feature in its social and
political life. Nor can I neglect to add, that kindred in
character, though involving no loss of property, was the
entire obliteration at the same time of the historic Provinces
of France, and the substitution of new divisions
into Departments, with new landmarks and new names,
so that ancient landmarks and ancient names, quickening
so many prejudices, no longer served to separate
the people.</p>

<p>But this story is not yet ended. Accustomed to
confiscation at home, France did not hesitate to exercise
it abroad, under the name of contributions; nor was
there anything her strong hand did not appropriate,&mdash;sometimes,
it might be, the precious treasures of Art,
paintings of Raffaelle, Titian, or Paul Potter, enshrined
in foreign museums, and sometimes the ornaments of
churches, palaces, and streets. Often in hard money
were these contributions levied. For instance, in 1807,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
Napoleon exacted from Prussia, with little more than
five million inhabitants, a war contribution of more
than one hundred and twenty millions of dollars; and
in 1809, the same conqueror exacted from Austria
a like contribution of about fifty millions of dollars.
In kindred spirit, Davoust, one of his marshals, stationed
at Hamburg, levied upon that single commercial
city, during the short term of twelve months,
contributions amounting to more than fifteen, or, according
to other accounts, twenty-five, millions of dollars.
But the day of reckoning came, when France,
humbled at last, was constrained to accept peace from
the victorious allies encamped at Paris. The paintings,
the marbles, and the ornaments ravished from foreign
capitals were all taken back, while immense sums
were exacted for expenses of the war, and also for spoliations
during the Revolution, amounting in all to
three hundred million dollars. Such is the lesson of
France.</p>

<p>And still later, actually in our day, the large possessions
of the late king, Louis Philippe, were confiscated
by Louis Napoleon, while every member of the Orléans
family was compelled to dispose of his property before
the expiration of a year, under penalty of forfeiture and
confiscation. This harsh act had its origin in the assumed
necessities of self-defence, that this powerful
family might be excluded from France, not only in person,
but in property also, and have no foothold or influence
there.</p>

<p>While it is easy to see that these interesting instances
are only slightly applicable to our country, yet I
do not disown any suggestion of caution or clemency
they inculcate. Other instances in our own history<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
are more applicable. All are aware that during the
Revolution the property of Tories, loyalists, and refugees
was confiscated; but I doubt if Senators know
the extent to which this was done, or the animosity by
which it was impelled. Out of many illustrations, I select
the early language of the patriot Hawley, of Massachusetts,
in a letter to Elbridge Gerry, under date of
July 17, 1776. “Can we subsist,” said this patriot, “did
any state ever subsist, without exterminating traitors?…
It is amazingly wonderful, that, having no capital
punishment for our intestine enemies, we have not been
utterly ruined before now.”<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> The statutes of the time
are most authentic testimony. I hold in my hand a
list, amounting to <em>eighty-eight</em> in number, which I have
arranged according to States. Some are very severe,
as may be imagined from the titles, which I proceed
to give; but they show, beyond assertion or argument,
how, under the exigencies of war for National Independence,
the power of confiscation was recognized and
employed. Each title is a witness.</p>

<p>Such is the array which illustrates the terrible earnestness
of those times. In their struggle for National
Independence, our fathers did not hesitate to employ all
the acknowledged Rights of War; nor did they higgle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
over questions of form with regard to enemies in arms
against them. To this extent, at least, we may be instructed
by their example, even if we discard their precedents.</p>

<p>In the negotiations for the acknowledgment of National
Independence these Acts were much considered.
It does not appear, however, that their legality was
drawn into question, although, as is seen, they exercised
the double rights of sovereignty and of war.
The British Commissioner, Mr. Oswald, expresses himself,
under date of November 4, 1782, as follows.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“You may remember, that, from the very first beginning
of our negotiation for settling a peace between Great Britain
and America, I insisted that you should positively stipulate
for the restoration of the property of all those persons, under
the denomination of the Loyalists or Refugees, who have
taken part with Great Britain in the present war: or, if the
property had been resold, and passed into such a variety of
hands as to render the restoration impracticable, (which you
asserted to be the case in many instances,) you should stipulate
for a compensation or indemnification to those persons
adequate to their losses.”<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The American Commissioners, John Adams, Benjamin
Franklin, and John Jay, declared in reply, that “the
restoration of such of the estates of the refugees as have
been confiscated is impracticable, because they were
confiscated by laws of particular States, and in many
instances have passed by legal titles through several
hands.” As to the demand of compensation for these
persons, the Commissioners said: “We forbear enumerating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
our reasons for thinking it ill-founded.”<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> In
the course of the conference, and by way of reply or
set-off, gross instances were adduced of outrages by the
British troops in “the carrying off of goods from Boston,
Philadelphia, and the Carolinas, Georgia, Virginia, &amp;c.,
and the burning of the towns.” Franklin mentioned
“the case of Philadelphia, and the carrying off of effects
there, even his own library.” Laurens added “the plunders
in Carolina of negroes, plate, &amp;c.”<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> In a letter from
Franklin to the British Commissioner, under date of November
26, 1782, the pretension of the loyalists was
finally repelled in the plainest words.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“You may well remember, that, in the beginning of our
conferences, before the other Commissioners arrived, on your
mentioning to me a retribution for the loyalists whose estates
had been forfeited, … I gave it as my opinion and advice,
honestly and cordially, that, if a reconciliation was intended,
no mention should be made in our negotiations of those people;
for, they having done infinite mischief to our properties,
by wantonly burning and destroying farm-houses, villages,
and towns, if compensation for their losses were insisted on,
we should certainly exhibit against it an account of all the
ravages they had committed, which would necessarily recall
to view scenes of barbarity that must inflame, instead of conciliating,
and tend to perpetuate an enmity that we all profess
a desire of extinguishing.…</p>

<p>“Your ministers require that we should receive again into
our bosom those who have been our bitterest enemies, and
restore their properties who have destroyed ours,&mdash;and this
while the wounds they have given us are still bleeding. It
is many years since your nation expelled the Stuarts and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>their adherents, and confiscated their estates. Much of your
resentment against them may by this time be abated; yet,
if we should propose it, and insist on it, as an article of our
treaty with you, that that family should be recalled and the
forfeited estates of its friends restored, would you think us
serious in our professions of earnestly desiring peace?</p>

<p>“I must repeat my opinion, that it is best for you to drop
all mention of the refugees.”<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

</div>

<p>But on this occasion there was a compromise. Instead
of positive stipulations in behalf of the loyalists,
it was agreed in the treaty, “that the Congress shall
earnestly <em>recommend</em> it to the Legislatures of the respective
States to provide for the restitution of all estates,
rights, and properties which have been confiscated, belonging
to <em>real</em> British subjects, and also of the estates,
rights, and properties of persons resident in districts in
the possession of his Majesty’s arms, <em>and who have not
borne arms against the said United States</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Thus, while
in every other article of the treaty it was agreed that
certain things <em>shall be done</em>, here it was only agreed to
<em>recommend</em> that they shall be done; and even the recommendation
of restitution was confined to what are called
“<em>real</em> British subjects,” and others “who have not borne
arms against the United States,”&mdash;thus evidently recognizing
the liability of those who did not come within
these two exceptions.</p>

<p>After the adoption of our Constitution, this article
came under discussion between the United States and
Great Britain, when Mr. Jefferson, in the most elaborate
diplomatic paper of his life, ably vindicated the conduct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
of our Government. It was on this occasion that he
quoted the words of Bynkershoek, that “it stands to
reason that whatever property of an enemy is found
in his enemy’s country changes its owner and goes
to the treasury, … even immovables, as is the practice
in regard to movables.”<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> And in the course of
his argument he distinctly asserts that “an Act of the
Legislature confiscating lands stands in place of <em>an office
found</em> in ordinary cases,&mdash;and that, on the passage
of the Act, as on the finding of the office, the State
stands <i>ipso facto</i> possessed of the lands without a formal
entry. The confiscation, then, is complete by the
passage of the Act, both the title and possession being
divested out of the former proprietor and vested in the
State.”<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>This is strong language. Not only in our diplomacy,
but also in our courts, was the validity of these Acts
upheld. Mr. Jefferson was sustained by the Supreme
Court of the United States in an early case on the confiscation
of British debts by Virginia,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> where it was declared
that “a State may make what rules it pleases, and
those rules must necessarily have place within itself,”<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>&mdash;that
“the right to confiscate the property of enemies
during war is derived from a state of war, and is called
the Rights of War,”<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>&mdash;and that “the right acquired
by war depends on the power of seizing the enemy’s effects.”<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
The last remark has a subtle significance. But
the whole case was stated at the bar by John Marshall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
afterwards our honored Chief Justice, in words applicable
to our own times.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It has been conceded that independent nations have
in general the right of confiscation, and that Virginia at the
time of passing her law was an independent nation. But
it is contended, that, from the peculiar circumstances of the
war, the citizens of each of the contending nations having
been members of the same government, the general right of
confiscation did not apply, and ought not to be exercised.
It is not, however, necessary to show a parallel case in history,
since it is incumbent on those who wish to impair the
sovereignty of Virginia to establish on principle or precedent
the justice of their exception. <em>That State, being engaged in a
war, necessarily possessed the powers of war, and confiscation is
one of those powers, weakening the party against whom it is
employed, and strengthening the party that employs it.</em>”<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In closing what I have to say of the confiscation bills
of the Revolution, I cannot disguise that they have been
thought severe in some cases beyond the acknowledged
exigencies of the times; but, admitting their severity,
they testify none the less to those Rights of War in
which they had their origin.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such, Sir, are examples of history, so far as I can
gather them, to guide on the present occasion. The
embarrassment of Hercules is constantly repeated. There
are paths to avoid, as well as paths to take; and it is for
you to determine, under the lights of the past, how your
course shall be directed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There are considerations of <em>policy</em>, and, I rejoice to
believe, of justice also, which furnish illumination such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
as cannot be found in any other instances of history.
If we go astray, it must be from blindness.</p>

<p>In determining what powers to exercise, you will be
guided to a certain extent by the object you seek to
accomplish. Do you seek really to put down the Rebellion,
and to tread it out forever, or do you seek only
the passage of a penal statute? Do you seek a new
and decisive weapon in the war our country is compelled
to wage, or do you seek nothing more than to
punish a few rebels? Or, if the object you seek is
simply punishment, do you wish it to be sure and effective,
or only in name? Are you in earnest to strike
this rebellion with all the force sanctioned by the
Rights of War, or do you refuse to use anything beyond
the peaceful process of Municipal Law? I put
these questions sincerely and kindly. You will answer
them by your votes. If you are not in earnest against
the rebellion now arrayed in war, if you are content <em>to
seem</em> without acting, <em>to seem</em> without striking, in short,
<em>to seem</em> rather than <em>to be</em>, you will pass a new penal
statute, and nothing more.</p>

<p>It is clear that such a statute will be of perfect inefficiency.
It will not produce even a moderate intimidation,&mdash;not
so much as a Quaker gun. With the provision
in our Constitution applicable to jury trials in
criminal cases, it is obvious that throughout the whole
Rebel country there can be no conviction under such
statute. Proceedings would fail through the disagreement
of the jury, while the efforts of counsel would
make every case an occasion of irritation. People talk
flippantly of the gallows as the certain doom of the
Rebels. This is a mistake. For weal or woe, the gallows
is out of the question. It is not possible as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
punishment for this rebellion.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Nor would any forfeiture
or confiscation whatever be sanctioned by a
jury in the Rebel country. I think that in this judgment
I do not err. But if this be correct, surely we
should take all proper steps to avoid such failure of
justice. Let Senators see things as they are; let us not
deceive ourselves or deceive others. A new statute
against treason will be simply a few more illusive pages
on the statute-book, and that is all.</p>

<p>I cannot doubt that Senators are in earnest, that
they mean what they say, and that they intend to do
all in their power, by all proper legislation, to bring the
war to a final close. But if this be their purpose, they
will not hesitate to employ all the acknowledged Rights
of War calculated to promote this end. Two transcendent
powers have been exercised without a murmur:
first, to raise armies, and, secondly, to raise money.
These were essential to the end. But there is another
power, without which, I fear, the end will escape us.
It is that of confiscation and liberation; and this power
is just as constitutional as the other two. The occasion
for its exercise is found in the same terrible necessity.
An army is not a <i>posse comitatus</i>; nor is it, when in
actual war, face to face with the enemy, amenable to
the ordinary provisions of the Constitution. It takes
life without a jury trial, or any other process of law;
and we have already seen, it is by virtue of the same
Right of War that the property of enemies may be
taken, and freedom given to their slaves. On the exercise
of these rights there can be no check or limitation
in the Constitution. Any such check or limitation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
would be irrational. War cannot be conducted <i>in vinculis</i>.
Seeking to fasten upon it the restraints of the
Constitution, you repeat the ancient tyranny which compelled
its victims to fight in chains. Glorious as it is
that the citizen is surrounded by the safeguards of the
Constitution, yet this rule is superseded by war, bringing
into being other rights which know no master. An
Italian publicist has said that there is no right which
does not, in some measure, impinge upon some other
right. But this is not correct. The Rights of War can
never impinge upon any rights under the Constitution,
nor can any rights under the Constitution impinge upon
the Rights of War. Rights, when properly understood,
harmonize with each other.</p>

<p>Assuming, then, what is so amply demonstrated, that
the Rights of War are ours without abridgment, and
assuming also that you will not allow the national
cause, which has enlisted such mighty energies, to be
thwarted through any failure on your part, I ask you to
exercise these rights in such way as to insure promptly
and surely that permanent peace in which is contained
all we desire. But to this end mere victory will not be
enough. The Rebellion must be so completely crushed
that it cannot again break forth, while its authors have
penalties to bear, all of which may be accomplished only
by such a bill as I have proposed. The reasons of
policy, as well as of duty, are controlling.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But while all desire to see the Rebellion completely
crushed, there may be difference with regard to the
Rights of War to be exercised. Some may be for
part; others may be for all. Some may reject the examples
of the past; others may insist upon them. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
is for you to choose; but, in making election, you will
not forget the object in view. At another point I have
leaned on the authority of Grotius. Turning now to
Vattel, a writer of masculine understanding, who has
done much to popularize the Law of Nations, I am
influenced by the consideration, that, less austere than
others, he seems always inspired by the free air of
his native Switzerland, and filled with the desire of
doing good, so that what he sanctions cannot be regarded
as illiberal or harsh. In grouping the details
entering into the object proposed, this benevolent master
teaches that we may seek these things:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Possession of what belongs to us;</p>

<p>2. Expenses and charges of the war, with reparation
of damages;</p>

<p>3. Reduction of the enemy, so that he shall be incapable
of unjust violence;</p>

<p>4. Punishment of the enemy.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>And in order to arrive at these results, the Rights of
War are ours, to be employed in our discretion. Nor
is it to be forgotten that these rights are without any
of those limitations which modern times have adopted
with regard to the private property of enemies in international
war, and that, on reason and principle, which
are the foundations of all Public Law, <em>every rebel who
voluntarily becomes an enemy is as completely responsible
in all his property, whether real or personal, as a hostile
Government or Prince</em>, whose responsibility to this extent
is unquestioned.</p>

<p>Such in detail is the object that is all contained in
the idea of peace. In this work it is needless to say
there is no place for any sentiment of hate or any suggestion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
of vengeance. There can be no exaction and no
punishment beyond the necessity of the case,&mdash;nothing
harsh, nothing excessive. Lenity and pardon become
the conqueror more even than victory. “Do in time of
peace the most good, and in time of war the least evil
possible: such is the Law of Nations.” These are the
admirable words of an eminent French magistrate and
statesman.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> In this spirit it is our duty to assuage the
calamities of war, and especially to spare an inoffensive
population.</p>

<p>But not so should we deal with conspirators. For
those who organized this great crime and let slip the
dogs of war there can be no penalty too great. They
should be not only punished to the extent of our power,
but stripped of all means of influence, so that, should
their lives be spared, they may be doomed to wear
them out in poverty, if not in exile. To this end
their property must be taken. Their poor deluded
followers may be safely pardoned. Left to all the
privileges of citizenship in a regenerated land, they
will unite in judgment of leaders who have been to
them such cruel taskmasters.</p>

<p>The property of the leaders consists largely of land,
owned in extensive plantations. It is just that these
should be broken up, so that never again can they be
nurseries of conspiracy or disaffection. Partitioned into
small estates, they will afford homes to many now
homeless, while their peculiar and overbearing social
influence will be destroyed. Poor neighbors, so long
dupes and victims, will become independent possessors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
of the soil. Brave soldiers, who have left their Northern
skies to fight the battles of their country, resting at
last from their victories, and changing their swords for
ploughshares, will fill the land with Northern industry
and Northern principles.</p>

<p>I say little of personal property, because, although
justly liable to confiscation, yet it is easy to see that it
is of much less importance than the land, except so far
as slaves are falsely classed under that head.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Vattel says that in our day a soldier would not dare
to boast of having killed the enemy’s king; and there
seems to be similar timidity on our part towards Slavery,
which is our enemy’s king. If this king were removed,
tranquillity would reign. Charles the Twelfth,
of Sweden, did not hesitate to say that the cannoneers
were perfectly right in directing their shots at him;
for the war would instantly end, if they could kill him;
whereas they would reap little from killing his principal
officers. There is no shot in this war so effective
as one against Slavery, which is king above all
officers; nor is there any better augury of complete
success than the willingness, at last, to fire upon this
wicked king. The illusions through which Slavery has
become strong must be abandoned.</p>

<p>The slaves of Rebels cannot be regarded as property,
real or personal. Though claimed as property by their
masters, and though too often recognized as such by
individuals in the National Government, it is the glory
of our Constitution that it treats slaves always as
“persons.” At home, beneath the lash and local law,
they may be chattels; but they are known to our Constitution
only as <em>men</em>. In this simple and indisputable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
fact there is a distinction, clear as justice itself, between
the pretended property in slaves and all other property,
real or personal. Being men, they are bound to allegiance,
and entitled to reciprocal protection. It only
remains that a proper appeal should be made to their
natural and instinctive loyalty. Nor can any pretended
property of their masters supersede this claim, I will
not say of eminent domain, but of eminent power, inherent
in the National Government, which at all times
has a right to the services of all. Declaring the slaves
free, you will at once do more than in any other way,
whether to conquer, to pacify, to punish, or to bless.
You will take from the Rebellion its mainspring of activity
and strength; you will stop its chief source of
provisions and supplies; you will remove a motive and
temptation to prolonged resistance; and you will destroy
forever that disturbing influence, which, so long
as allowed, will keep this land a volcano ever ready to
break forth anew. While accomplishing this work, you
will at the same time do an act of wise economy, giving
new value to all the lands of Slavery, and opening untold
springs of wealth; and you will also do an act of
justice, destined to raise our national name more than
any triumph of war or any skill in peace. God, in His
beneficence, offers to nations, as to individuals, opportunity,
<em>opportunity</em>, <span class="smcap">opportunity</span>, which, of all things,
is most to be desired. Never before in history has He
offered such as is ours here. Do not fail to seize it.
The blow with which we smite an accursed Rebellion
will at the same time enrich and bless; nor is there
any prosperity or happiness it will not scatter abundantly
throughout the land. Such an act will be an
epoch, marking the change from Barbarism to Civilization.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
By old Rights of War, still prevalent in Africa,
freemen were made slaves; but by the Rights of War
which I ask you to exercise slaves will be made freemen.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. President, if you seek Indemnity for the Past
and Security for the Future, if you seek the national
unity under the Constitution of the United States,
here is the way. Strike down the leaders of the Rebellion,
and lift up the slaves.</p>

<div class="verse">“To tame the proud, the fettered slave to free,&mdash;</div>

<p>Then will there be Indemnity for the Past such as no
nation ever before was able to win, and there will be
Security for the Future such as no nation ever before
enjoyed, while the Republic, strengthened and glorified,
will be assured forever, one and indivisible.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>May 23d, the Senate proceeded to consider a resolution offered the
preceding day by Mr. Sumner:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That the Committee on the District of Columbia be directed
to consider what legislation, if any, is needed to protect persons of African
descent in Washington from unconstitutional seizure as fugitive slaves, or
from seizure by disloyal persons.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;The question presented in
this resolution has a practical value to-day, when,
here in Washington, we are shocked by efforts of slave-hunters,
coming from an adjoining State, to carry off
human beings as slaves. This is menaced on a large
scale. Whole hecatombs are to be sacrificed. A Philadelphia
paper of this morning, “The Press,” which I find
on my table, contains, under the telegraphic head, an
account of certain proceedings instituted by persons
called Commissioners, who have undertaken gravely to
decide, that, in a case of human freedom, “it was discretionary
with them to allow cross-examination as to
identity and ownership.” According to these wise Daniels,
a person may be doomed to Slavery, even without
any cross-examination of witnesses against him. The
statement of this assumption shows the outrage which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
offends justice and common sense, and, I am happy to
believe, the Constitution also, even if it be assumed that
anybody now can be treated as a slave in the District.</p>

<p>The much discussed clause of the Constitution bearing
on this question provides that “no person held to
service or labor <em>in one State</em>, under the laws thereof,
<em>escaping into another</em>, shall, in consequence of any law
or regulation therein, be discharged from such service
or labor.” It will be observed that this is limited to
escape <em>from one State into another State</em>. Nothing is
said of escape into Territories, or into the District of
Columbia. If made applicable to Territories or the
District, it is only by inference and deduction, and
not by virtue of any express words.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this omission in the Constitution,
the Act of 1793, providing for the surrender of fugitives
from service, was made applicable to escape into Territories,
and this questionable precedent was followed in
the terrible Act of 1850. But neither of these Acts was
made applicable to escape into the District of Columbia.
While Slavery prevailed in the District, it was difficult
to raise a question with regard to the surrender of fugitive
slaves. But since Freedom has happily become the
law here, the case is materially changed. Slaves at last
are beginning to have rights. And the question arises,
whether, in the absence of express power in the Constitution,
and also in the absence of express words in
any statute, commissioners can undertake to surrender
men into Slavery. Even if there were express words in
the statute, we should be obliged to find express words
also in the Constitution, which is the source of the
power. But there are no words applicable to this pretension
either in statute or Constitution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir, I have always understood, that, in the interpretation
of statutes, and especially of the Constitution, every
word is to be interpreted in favor of life and liberty,&mdash;<i>in
favorem vitæ ac libertatis</i>. Indeed, one of the received
maxims of the Common Law says strongly, “Impious
and cruel is he to be adjudged who does not favor Liberty.”<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
If these maxims are not entirely rejected, it is
impossible to find, either in statute or Constitution, any
power to gratify the hunters now thronging this District
in quest of human prey. It is <i>casus omissus</i> in our
texts legislative or constitutional, and no commissioner,
in the plenitude of petty power, can undertake to supply
words which do not appear in statute or Constitution.
It is for them only to administer the law as it is,
and not to make it, especially against Freedom. They
are not greater than the Constitution; and they should
know that human freedom, in the estimation of every
civilized jurisprudence, is priceless.</p>

<p>The question which I now raise, if I may employ the
language of lawyers, is proper for the courts. A court
in Washington, properly inspired, could not hesitate in
its conclusion. It would deny any such offensive prerogative,
unless sanctioned by clear and positive words.
In the absence of such words, it would rejoice to set
aside the whole pretension. It would not hesitate or
halt, but it would do it gladly, generously, justly, and
make a new precedent by which civilization should
be advanced. Yet this is too much to expect from the
courts of Washington, whose sense of justice has been
enfeebled by the atmosphere of Slavery.</p>

<p>This pretension is aggravated by the fact that many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
of these hunters are notoriously disloyal. Sir, it is hard
that our Constitution should be violated, and men hurried
into Slavery, at the trumpery process of such offensive
characters. I think the Committee will find a
remedy.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>In the consideration of the Internal Tax Bill Mr. Sumner took an
active part, as the <i>Congressional Globe</i> attests.</p>

<p>When this bill came from the House of Representatives, it contained
a tax of one cent a pound on cotton. The Finance Committee of the
Senate reported against this tax. Mr. Sumner, though never disposed
to spare Slavery, was unwilling to bear hard on an interest so important
as cotton to the whole country, especially to the South when redeemed,
as well as to the manufactures of the North, and therefore exerted himself
against the tax. May 27th, he spoke as follows.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;I am in favor of the proposition
of the Committee, which seems to me sound
in principle and policy.</p>

<p>There are reasons against taxing cotton,&mdash;first, from
the character of the product itself, and, secondly, from
the effect of the tax on manufactures.</p>

<p>If we look at the character of the product, we find, in
the first place, that it is agricultural,&mdash;peculiar, indeed,
to one section of the country, but as much an agricultural
product as grain, hemp, and flax, which are left untouched
by this bill. There should be reason for adopting
the tax in one case and not in the other. No such
reason exists.</p>

<p>But cotton is not only an agricultural product, it is
also a leading export. Now I raise no constitutional
question on the power to tax exports, although it may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
not be entirely easy to reconcile such tax with the language
of the Constitution: “No tax or duty shall be
laid on articles exported from any State.” The object
of this clause was to prevent discrimination among
States through the taxing power. But not questioning
the power in the present case, it seems to me that its
exercise is of doubtful policy, according to principles of
political economy. I do not think that it is the policy
of civilized nations to tax exports, which play an important
part, first, in quickening commerce, and, secondly,
in furnishing the equivalent of imports.</p>

<p>Then there is difficulty arising from the condition of
the country. Until the Cotton States are restored to
the Union, little or no revenue can be expected from
any such tax. But if their representatives were once
more here, can anybody suppose it possible to tax this
great staple of the South, while the great staples of the
West&mdash;grain, provisions, and wool&mdash;are free? It
seems to me unadvisable to attempt, in the absence of
these representatives, what we would not attempt, if
they were present,&mdash;in other words, to do what is of
doubtful equity, simply because we have the votes.
Our tax, at best, can be little more than prospective.
Is it not better to wait till it may be a reality?</p>

<p>Even if at another time the tax on cotton seemed
politic, I doubt if it can be so regarded for some time
to come. Considering the peculiar condition of things,
there is small doubt that the country for the next five
years will have greater interest in encouraging the production
of cotton than in taxing it.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is said, that, if cotton is not taxed, the
Cotton States will escape taxation, which would be a
practical injustice to other parts of the country. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
I am not satisfied that we cannot tax their slaves. Besides,
the $200,000,000 of cotton exported assures the
importation of $200,000,000 of foreign products, which,
with twenty-five per cent duty, gives a revenue of $50,000,000
annually.</p>

<p>But if cotton must be taxed, it should not be by a
specific tax, but by a tax <i>ad valorem</i>, and for obvious
reason. Cotton is sold in the market under seven different
grades, varying materially in value. These grades
are classified as follows, beginning with the lowest or
least valuable, and ending with the highest or most valuable:
(1.) ordinary, (2.) good ordinary, (3.) low middling,
(4.) middling, (5.) good middling, (6.) middling
fair, (7.) Sea Island. For ten years, from 1850 to 1860,
the average price of ordinary cotton was six and five
eighths cents a pound, while middling fair, the highest
grade except Sea Island, averaged twelve cents a pound.
A tax of one cent a pound on ordinary cotton would be
over fifteen per cent on its value, while one cent a
pound on middling fair cotton would be eight and one
third per cent, and the same tax on Sea Island cotton,
commanding the highest price of all, would be less than
five per cent.</p>

<p>The tax on cotton, if any is imposed, ought not to exceed
five per cent <i>ad valorem</i>. In the natural course of
events, without interruption of war, the cotton exported
would have amounted in value for a year to $200,000,000.
If to this we add the value of cotton used in the
United States, $35,000,000, we shall have the sum-total
of $235,000,000. A tax of five per cent <i>ad valorem</i> on
this would be $11,750,000.</p>

<p>The proposed tax of one cent a pound is much larger.
During the year ending the 30th of June, 1860, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
value of the cotton exported was $191,806,555, and the
number of pounds exported was 1,767,686,338. A tax of
one cent a pound would be $17,676,863,&mdash;a very large
sum, which I should be glad to pour into our Treasury.
But, assuming the value of this cotton at ten and eight
tenths cents a pound, the tax of one cent a pound will
be above nine and one fourth per cent,&mdash;nearly double
what the tax ought to be.</p>

<p>Consider now, if you please, the effect of this tax on
cotton manufactures. It appears that we manufacture
annually about seven hundred thousand bales of cotton,
one half of which is of the three lower grades, and is
worked into what is called by manufacturers coarse
goods. Of these one pound of cotton will make about
two and a half yards, worth twenty cents. Now a tax
of three per cent on this cloth would be six mills. Add
the tax of one cent a pound on cotton, and you have a
total of sixteen mills, making a tax of eight per cent on
the value of the cloth,&mdash;a higher tax than is imposed
by the Tax Bill on anything except dogs, whiskey, and
tobacco.</p>

<p>The rest of the cotton manufactured in our country
is worked into what are called fine goods, of which one
pound will make from four to eight yards, valued at
thirty to forty cents, or, on an average, thirty-five cents.
The tax of three per cent on these goods at thirty-five
cents would be ten and a half mills. Add the tax of
one cent on the cotton, which is ten mills, and you have
the total of twenty and a half mills, making a tax on
this article of more than five and eight tenths per cent.</p>

<p>Of the finest goods, a pound of cotton would make
cloth worth seventy-five cents. The tax upon this class
would be four and one third per cent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus the cheap goods used by the poorer people will
be taxed much higher than the finer goods used by the
rich. Are you ready to set up this discrimination?</p>

<p>There is an important export trade of cotton manufactures,
which must not be forgotten. But these are
entirely of the class known as coarse goods. For instance,
during the year ending June 30, 1860, cotton
goods exported amounted to $10,934,796. This commerce
is conducted under difficulties. Necessarily it
encounters strong competition in the foreign markets,
and must have failed, but for the anomalous opportunities
it enjoyed in China and the East Indies, where
these goods were often sent as remittances instead of
bills of exchange, it being cheaper to pay for them in
Boston even more than they will bring at their destination
than to pay the premium of exchange. But this
business, having such anomalous support, cannot bear
additional burden. It will be annihilated,&mdash;at least I
am so assured by those who ought to know.</p>

<p>The proposed tax upon coarse goods used in our country
is found, on calculation, equal to seven per cent on
the capital invested in their manufacture, and on exported
goods it is equal to five per cent. If cotton must
be taxed, it ought not to be higher than five per cent,
and I have already shown that it ought to be <i>ad valorem</i>.
On goods exported there should be a drawback in
favor of the manufacturer, not only of the three per cent
on the goods, but also of the five per cent on the cotton.
If the three per cent tax on all goods used in this country
were reduced to one and one half per cent <i>ad valorem</i>,
this, with the five per cent tax on the cotton, would
be equal to three and one sixth per cent <i>ad valorem</i> on
coarse goods, and to three and one third per cent on fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
goods. But I prefer the proposition of the Committee,
leaving the bill otherwise as it is.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I have to say that the cotton cloths
manufactured in our country are nearly as much a necessary
as breadstuffs, entering into the daily life of all,
whether rich or poor, like daily bread.</p>

<p>In the debate which ensued, Mr. Davis, of Kentucky, alluded to

Senator from Rhode Island, for the past year. I do not believe that the man
lives, that the child lives, who will ever see, after the universal emancipation
of the slaves, under any state of labor, or of care, or of application of labor,

<hr class="tb" />

<p>June 3d, at the next stage of the bill, the question was presented
again, when Mr. Sumner renewed his opposition to the tax. In the
course of his remarks the following passages occurred.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Then, Sir, as I had the honor of saying
in the former debate, suppose the vacant seats on
the other side of the Chamber were filled, suppose Senators
here from the Cotton States, would you think
of imposing a tax on cotton without in the same bill
imposing a tax on the agricultural products of the
North? You would not, I am sure; and, Sir, in their
absence, I will not do what I would not do, if I could,
were they here.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Grimes.</span> Would you not abolish Slavery in the
District of Columbia?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I would do that, were they here, and propose
it to their faces, and be too happy in the opportunity.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>June 4th, the debate was continued, when Mr. Sumner spoke as
follows.</p>

</div>

<p>I am admonished by my friend, the Senator from
Maine [Mr. <span class="smcap">Fessenden</span>], not to say anything. I shall
say very little. I am in favor of reducing the tax from
one cent to half a cent, and I am also in favor of striking
out the whole tax. If there must be a tax, I wish
the smallest; and if I can have the attention of the
Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. <span class="smcap">Howe</span>], whose remarks
were so candid, I should like to put him a question.
You heard him say that he would not impose any
tax which he knew would really be burdensome on
the manufacturers. Other Senators have repeated the
same thing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, Sir, on whom will he rely, in determining
whether the tax will be burdensome? I take it that
the manufacturers are competent witnesses, if not the
best witnesses; and Senators from manufacturing States,
when they express themselves on the question, are to be
heard. But it is the clear opinion of the manufacturers
that the proposed tax will be burdensome, that it will
almost annihilate a certain branch of trade with China
and the East Indies, and that it will be most oppressive
on the coarser fabrics at home. The tax on the latter
will swell to as much as seven per cent, which is a very
large tax, larger than is imposed on anything else in
the bill, unless it be whiskey and dogs.</p>

<p>I put it to the Senator from Wisconsin, who so candidly
said that he would not impose a tax that he knew
to be burdensome, whose testimony will he accept?
On what will he rely? Is it his own knowledge, his
own impressions, his own imagination, if you please?
In answer to all these I present the positive testimony
of those really familiar with the subject.</p>

<p>Here, then, is the question in a nutshell. In imposing
this tax, you have on one side the certainty of undue
burden on a special interest; and what have you
on the other side? An uncertainty. Who here can
say that the proposed tax will be productive? Sir, we
have not the cotton in our hands. Through the machinations
of wicked men, it has ceased to be within our
possession. I remember in my childhood being much
amused with a little poem entitled “Oxen in the
Skies,” which pleasantly described a contest between
two senseless persons as to who should own certain
imagined oxen in the skies,&mdash;that is, a contest about
something not within reach. The cotton you propose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
to tax is not within reach. I trust that it may soon
be. Should we not act on existing facts, rather than
on hopes?</p>

<p>There is a larger view of the question. While you
begin to tax the agricultural products of the country,
you open the door to that great experiment. If the
Senate is ready to march in that direction, I will not
say whether I am not ready to march also; but the
Senate should not commence the experiment without
considering where it leads. In this whole bill you do
not tax a single agricultural product. Why, therefore,
make an exception of cotton? If you begin with cotton,
where will you stop? Must you not also tax hemp, flax,
and corn? Why not? Not that I am in favor of such
taxation; but where in principle are you to stop? Sir,
I put these questions as a warning to Senators.</p>

<p>While voting and speaking against a tax on cotton, Mr. Sumner
was anxious to tax Slavery, and this he sought to accomplish by a tax
on those who pretended to hold slaves.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>May 28th, he moved the following amendment:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>And be it further enacted</i>, That any person who shall claim the service
or labor for life of any other person, under the laws of any State, shall pay,
on account of such person so claimed, the sum of ten dollars.”</p>

</div>

<p>And then said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;A tax of ten dollars on account
of each slave will give $40,000,000. And
in putting the tax at ten dollars I follow the precedent
of the Constitution, which taxes slaves imported at ten
dollars. I do not disguise that on this question I have
shared the doubts of others. Of course, no tax would
be tolerable which gave any sanction to property in
man; and it has been feared that a tax on slaves might
be interpreted into such sanction. This fear is not
unnatural to persons shocked by the idea of Slavery.
It was early avowed by Roger Sherman, of Connecticut,
whose sensibility is recorded by Madison in his report
of the debates in the Federal Convention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

the matter worse, because it implied they were property.”<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Again, a few days later, when the same clause of the
Constitution was under discussion, Mr. Sherman repeated
his objection, and the following debate occurred,
which seems to exhaust the argument on both sides.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Mr. Sherman</span> was against this second part, as acknowledging
men to be property, by taxing them as such under
the character of slaves.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Colonel Mason.</span> Not to tax will be equivalent to a
bounty on the importation of slaves.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Mr. Gorham</span> thought that Mr. Sherman should consider
the duty, <em>not as implying that slaves are property</em>, but as a
discouragement to the importation of them.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Mr. Gouverneur Morris</span> remarked, that, as the clause
now stands, it implies that the Legislature may tax freemen
imported.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Mr. Sherman</span>, in answer to Mr. Gorham, observed, that
the smallness of the duty showed revenue to be the object,
not the discouragement of the importation.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Mr. Madison</span> thought it wrong to admit in the Constitution
the idea that there could be property in men. The
reason of duties did not hold, as slaves are not, like merchandise,
consumed, &amp;c.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Colonel Mason</span>, in answer to Mr. Gouverneur Morris.
The provision, as it stands, was necessary for the case of
convicts, in order to prevent the introduction of them.”<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

</div>

<p>After this discussion, the clause as found in the Constitution,
laying “a tax or duty on such importation,
not exceeding ten dollars for each person,” was adopted,
<i>nem. con.</i> Thus it appears that Sherman, Morris, Franklin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
and Gerry, to say nothing of Madison, all known
for opposition to Slavery, and determination to give it
no sanction, concurred in this proposition. They felt
that a tax or duty, thus arranged, was not a sanction of
Slavery.</p>

<p>The same question is now presented to us. Clearly
there can be no such thing as property in man. The
whole idea is offensive and odious. There is no revenue,
whatever be its amount, to compensate for this recognition.
Better be poor, better be pinched in means,
better forego much needed supplies, than obtain help
through any such sacrifice. But the same considerations
which induced our fathers, with all their avowed
scruples, to sustain such a tax or duty, may properly
influence us.</p>

<p>It is the boast of the Constitution that it knows
nobody as a slave. All are “persons.” But at the
same time it does not assume to interfere with a well-known
State institution by which “persons” are degraded
to be property. The condition of the slave is
anomalous. He is property by local law; he is a “person”
by the Constitution. But nobody questions the
existence of Slavery. It is a monstrous <em>fact</em>, beyond
reach in the States, except through the War Power,
and yet none the less a <em>fact</em>, which taxation will only
recognize, and not sanction. It is an intolerable nuisance
intrenched in State lines; but we shall not treat
it otherwise than as nuisance, when we tax it. In taxing
it we do not assume its rightfulness; we only
assume its undeniable existence as a <em>fact</em>, and nothing
else.</p>

<p>If our tax were an encouragement, it would be clearly
immoral. But it is a discouragement. Exemption<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
from taxation is encouragement. Taxation is discouragement
just in proportion to its extent, until, in the
progress of events, it becomes destructive. Regarding
the present question in this light, our course is plain.
It is not permissible to encourage Slavery, while every
principle of economy and every sentiment of justice and
humanity urge its discouragement.</p>

<p>But it is said that the Constitution prohibits a capitation
tax, “unless in proportion to the census.” The
tax I propose is not a capitation tax, any more than
the tax on auctioneers, or lawyers, or jugglers, or peddlers,
or slaughterers of cattle is a capitation tax.
According to lexicographers, a capitation tax is a
poll tax, a tax on each individual. Now this tax
makes no pretension to be a poll tax, or a tax on each
individual. It is a tax on a person who claims the
service or labor of another for life, proportioned to the
extent of his claim. In other words, <em>it is a tax on a
claim of property</em>; and when I tax this claim, surely I
do not recognize its morality, nor do I accord to it any
sanction.</p>

<p>If it be said, that at one time I insist the slave shall
have all the rights of “persons” under the Constitution,
while I now insist that his master shall pay a tax
on his claim of property, I reply, that there is no inconsistency,
but perfect harmony. By an unquestionable
rule of interpretation, applicable to the Constitution,
every word must be construed <em>in favor of Liberty</em>,
so as most to promote Liberty. According to this rule,
every presumption is in favor of Liberty. But, while
insisting upon every such presumption, it does not follow
that the counter claim shall not be taxed. Indeed,
the same principle which inclines in favor of the slave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
must incline also to tax the claim of his master, so long
as this claim exists in fact. Freedom is to be enlarged
in every way possible, whether by encouraging the
slave or discouraging the master. Therefore do I say
fearlessly, that the slave, whenever he appears within
the national jurisdiction or before national tribunals, is
entitled to all the rights of “persons”; but the master,
who asserts this odious property, cannot claim any immunity
for it on this account. The indulgence is all for
the slave, and not at all for the master. For the slave
Congress must do everything in its power; for the master
Congress must have nothing but disapprobation and
discouragement.</p>

<p>These are reasons that influence me, and I present
them now in order to influence those who hesitate to
impose this tax, on the old idea of Roger Sherman, that
it will be a recognition of property in man. Of course,
where Senators have no such scruple, the argument for
this tax is unanswerable.</p>

<p>It is easy to levy.</p>

<p>It is profitable.</p>

<p>And so far as it exerts an influence, it must be a
discouragement to an offensive wrong, which is the
parent of our present troubles, and the occasion of all
this taxation. It would be strange, if Slavery, after
causing our national calamity, should escape from all
its consequences. It would be strange, if Slavery,
which has played the tyrant thus far in our history,
should now, like the tyrant, be so far indulged as to
escape burdens of all kinds. It shall not be by my
vote.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Subsequently Mr. Sumner modified his amendment, by accepting a
substitute drawn by Mr. Simmons, of Rhode Island, in behalf of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
Finance Committee, who suggested, that “the section, as presented by
the Senator from Massachusetts, might leave the slave liable to be
sold to pay the tax, and that conflicts about as much with the Senator’s
notions as he could well have drawn any provision to do so.” Mr.
Sumner had no anxiety on this head, and said at once:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>Perhaps the Senator and myself start from different
points. I do not think the United States can own a
slave. I cannot doubt, that, if a slave should be seized
under process of the United States, he would be taken
to Freedom, and not to Slavery, for the simple reason
that the nation cannot own a slave. Therefore any
special provision for this emergency is superfluous. I
rest in the conviction, that, when a slave passes into the
hands of the United States, he at once becomes free.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Sumner added, that the proposition he had presented was “in
the plainest form and fewest words,” and on this account had merits of
its own.</p>

<p>Mr. Collamer hoped Mr. Sumner would accept the substitute, and
thought “ten dollars a head on all ages and conditions an unreasonable
tax.”</p>

<p>The substitute accepted by Mr. Sumner was as follows.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sec.</span>&mdash;<i>And be it further enacted</i>, That an annual tax of five dollars
shall be paid by every person or persons, corporation, or society, for and on
account of the service or labor of every other person between the ages of
ten and sixty-five years, whose service or labor, for a term of years or for
life, is claimed to be owned by such first mentioned person or persons, corporation,
or society, whether in a fiduciary capacity or otherwise, under
and by virtue of the laws or customs of any State; and said annual tax
shall be levied and collected of the person or persons, corporation, or society,
making such claim, and of their goods, chattels, or lands, as is herein before
provided; but in no case shall the person or persons whose service or labor
is so claimed, or their service or labor, be sold for the purpose of collecting
said tax: <i>Provided</i>, That this tax shall not apply to service due to parents.”<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Sherman, of Ohio, took the lead in answer to Mr. Sumner, and
in opposition to his amendment. After insisting that slaves are “persons,”
and that, if the amendment be adopted, “they will be the only
persons taxed under this bill,” he said:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If the Senator had made his argument yesterday, when we proposed to tax
cotton, a production which goes into manufactures, what he has said would
apply with great force. Cotton is a production of slave labor solely.…
All his arguments apply to cotton as a subject of taxation; but he convinced
a majority of the Senate yesterday that it was not expedient to tax cotton;
and now he proposes to tax slaves, and how?… With all our immense
resources, we cannot now collect it, except from the loyal people who live in
the Border States, who now recognize our flag and are subject to our law.
I am not willing to select them as the first to bear a heavy and peculiar
taxation. I believe that the true course is to insist upon the tax on
cotton.”<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The special points of Mr. Sherman’s opposition appear in Mr. Sumner’s
reply.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;I will make one remark in reply
to the Senator from Ohio. He objects to my proposition
as in the nature of a direct tax, or poll tax. How
is this? Has not the Senator voted to tax auctioneers,
lawyers, jugglers, and slaughterers of cattle, all being
classes of persons in the community?</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sherman.</span> To tax their employments.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> And I propose to tax the employment
of the slave-master,&mdash;that is all. It is the business of
the slave-master to make the slave work. This is his
high vocation. In other words, his business consists
in using the service and labor of another. And to
this class of persons he belongs. Is it not plain?
Can there be any doubt? Look at it. He is an auctioneer
of human rights, a broker of human labor, a juggler
of human sufferings and human sympathies,&mdash;I
might say a slaughterer of human hopes; and, Sir, if
the Senator from Ohio can tax auctioneer, broker, juggler,
or slaughterer of cattle, I am at a loss to understand
why he cannot tax the peculiar form of these vocations
all concurring in the slave-master. He is swift<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
to tax the less, but hesitates to tax the greater. He
can tax the petty employment, which is not immoral or
cruel; but he will not tax the larger multiform employment,
in which immorality and cruelty commingle.</p>

<p>But the Senator says it is a capitation or poll tax.
Not, Sir, in the sense of the Constitution. On this I
stand. It is simply a tax on a productive claim of property,
or, to borrow the language of the Senator a moment
ago, on an “employment.” It is nothing but that.</p>

<p>The Senator thinks it improper to tax slave-masters,
especially when we have cotton for taxation; and he
almost chides me, because yesterday I was against the
cotton tax, which in his judgment is most proper. Sir,
I am at a loss to find the parallel between the two
cases implied in supposing that one can be a substitute
for the other. They are unlike in every respect.
Slaves and cotton belong to the same section of country,
precisely as alligators and cotton; and that is all
the parallel between them. Cotton is an agricultural
product, entering into commerce and manufactures,
while the manufactures made from it are important
to all classes, but especially the poor. The question
of its taxation involves considerations of economy and
policy utterly unlike those arising on the motion to
tax the claim of the slave-master. It is difficult to see
how the two taxes can be confounded. One is a tax on
an agricultural product; the other is a tax on an odious
claim. The Senator will not say that it is an acceptable
claim under the Constitution. Even if there, it is
disguised under ambiguous words. Indeed, he knows
well that it is offensive and repugnant to the conscience
of good people. Shall not such a claim be taxed?
Shall such a claim be permitted to go scot-free? Shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
we run about the country, seeking class after class to
visit with oppressive taxation, and, under the lead of the
Senator, excuse this largest and most offensive class of
all? I am at a loss to understand on what ground of
principle the Senator can proceed, when he proposes
this special immunity. If I use strong terms in describing
slave-masters, it is because the very language
of the bill suggests them, and they are in essential conformity
with truth.</p>

<p>I believe I have answered the two objections made
by the Senator from Ohio. If he made any other, it has
escaped my recollection.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Sherman followed Mr. Sumner, beginning with these words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I will not reply to that part of the speech of the honorable Senator from
Massachusetts in which he denounced slaveholders. My opinions on this
subject are well known. I think that slaveholders have certain rights under
the Constitution of the United States; and while I never could be one
myself, and have as deep a repugnance to any law which authorizes the
holding of slaves as any other man, yet, while I am here under oath, I will
respect their constitutional rights to the fullest extent. We are bound to
legislate for them, and they are entitled to the protection of the Constitution
of the United States as fully as if they were here, all of them, to speak for
themselves; and especially I do not think it proper or courteous to use such
language, applied to a whole class of people, when Senators on this floor are
with us, associating with us, who are included by the appellation ‘slaveholder,’
so obnoxious to the Senator from Massachusetts. Certainly I cannot
characterize so harshly any one who is a member of the same body with
myself.”<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

</div>

<p>He then said that he intended “to put the proposition to tax cotton
and the proposition to tax slaves against each other,” and that he
would “propose to amend the amendment of the Senator from Massachusetts
by substituting a modified tax on cotton,”&mdash;that “they are
connected together, and the Senator cannot disconnect them.” He then
spoke of slave-masters again.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The slaveholders of the Revolution were men of the highest purity, of
the greatest patriotism. At that time Slavery was admitted to be an evil.
They were men of gentleness, of courtesy, of kindness, good hearts and good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>heads, nearly all of them; and so are the great body of the slaveholders with
whom you are brought in contact in the Border States, men of gentleness
and kindness and courtesy.… Many of the most gentlemanly, courteous,
kind, and patriotic men that I ever met in the world were slaveholders;
and I think, that, taken as a class, the slaveholders of the Border States
are men who are deserving of our commiseration, of our kindness, rather
than of our reproaches.… I do not choose to select that class of men
from among all the population of the Southern States and tax them, and
then to apply to them opprobrious epithets.”<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Sumner felt called to speak again in reply, and said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>The Senator from Ohio says that I propose a tax on
“slaves,” and then carefully reminds me that “slaves”
are persons, and therefore not, according to the Constitution,
to be taxed, except by a capitation tax. Now,
Sir, I have to say, in the first place, that the tax which
I propose is not to be regarded as a tax on slaves. If
applicable to persons, it is to the masters, and not to
the slaves. It is a tax on slave-masters, as I have already
said,&mdash;precisely like the tax on auctioneers,
which is sustained by the Senator. It is a tax on a
claim of property made by slave-masters. The Senator
may call such a claim property or not, as he pleases.
It is at least a claim of property, and as such I propose
to tax it. Why not? The Senator admits that at
other times slaves have been expressly taxed,&mdash;actually
taxed in name. In the tax of 1815 there was a
tax on “land <em>and slaves</em>.” The Senator does not doubt
the constitutionality of such tax. Sir, I am content
with this authority, which goes beyond anything that I
propose, and I am not troubled by any scruple, lest, in
imposing a tax on the claim of the slave-master, I
recognize property in man. At most, I recognize a
profitable claim, and tax it.</p>

<p>The remarks of the Senator were occupied chiefly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
with two heads,&mdash;first, eulogy of slave-masters, and,
secondly, vindication of his proposed tax on cotton. I
have little to say of the Senator’s eulogy. There are
two authorities on that head, which the Senator will
pardon me, if I place above him: I mean Mr. Jefferson
and Colonel Mason, both of our early Revolutionary days.
Mr. Jefferson assures us that the whole commerce between
master and slave is one of boisterous passion,
tending to barbarism.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> Colonel Mason exclaimed, in
the Convention to frame the Constitution, that every
slave-master is born a petty tyrant.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> And yet, Sir, in
the face of this authentic testimony, from persons who
knew Slavery and all its influences, the Senator eulogizes
slave-masters, and pleads for their exemption from
taxation. Eulogy is for the dead. I would not add to
the odium justly belonging to a tyrannical class, but I
do insist that justice shall be done to their victims;
and when the Senator interposes eulogy, I interpose
against him the rights which have been violated. So
long as men persist in such outrage, so long as they persevere
in maintaining an institution which annuls the
parental relation, the conjugal relation, the right to instruction,
the right to the fruit of one’s own labor, and
does all this merely to make men work without wages,
so long as men support this unjust and irrational pretence,
they must not expect soft words from me. If
the Senator from Ohio finds it in his generosity to
plead for slave-masters, he must excuse me, if I decline
to follow him. He does not know them as well as I do,
nor does he know their victims as well as I do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>The Senator dwells much on the importance of a tax
on cotton. The subject was fully canvassed yesterday,
and the vote of the Senate was against him. He now
seeks a re-hearing out of the ordinary course. Would it
not be better, if his proposition were postponed to the
next stage of the bill, when it will be strictly in order?
Meanwhile, in pursuance of my promise to be
brief, I content myself with saying, that the desire of
the Senate to tax cotton is no reason why they should
refuse to tax the claim of the slave-master. The two
are not in any way dependent upon each other. Let
the Senator from Ohio carry his cotton tax, if the Senate
agree with him. But, Sir, I insist, that, whether
cotton is taxed or not, the claim of the slave-master
shall not be permitted to escape. I do not say the
property, but I say the claim. It ought to be taxed,
not only for revenue, but also for the discouragement
it will fasten upon an odious pretension, which has been
to us the fountain of trouble and war.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Sherman’s motion to strike out the tax on slave-masters and
insert the tax on cotton was then lost,&mdash;Yeas 15, Nays 22.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. Henderson, of Missouri, then moved to amend the amendment
of Mr. Sumner by adding,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>And provided, further</i>, That the tax herein prescribed shall not be levied
or collected in any State where a system of gradual emancipation may have
been adopted at the time of the collection.”</p>

</div>

<p>May 29th, this was lost,&mdash;Yeas 15, Nays 20.</p>

<p>Then, on motion of Mr. Fessenden, Mr. Sumner’s amendment was
further modified by substituting a tax of “two” dollars, instead of
“five,” on account of each slave. Before the vote was taken, Mr. Sumner
assigned the reason for the higher rate.</p>

</div>

<p>The Senator from Maine [Mr. <span class="smcap">Fessenden</span>] said that
he had looked simply at the revenue to be obtained by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
a tax. But, pray, will not a larger revenue be obtained
at the rate of five dollars than at the rate of two? There
are the slaves,&mdash;count them, and tax them. The process
is simple, with no chance of evasion. Besides, Sir,
I cannot forget, nor can the Senator, that throughout our
history we have heard constantly of “incidental protection.”
But, if incidental protection is just and expedient,
then is incidental discouragement, and the tax I
propose may be sustained on this ground. We do not
hesitate to tax whiskey and tobacco as luxuries, indulgences,
vices. Why should we hesitate to tax the worst
luxury, the worst indulgence, the worst vice of all, which
is Slavery? Therefore, for a double reason, first, for the
sake of revenue, and, secondly, for the sake of discouragement
to Slavery, I am for the larger tax.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>After further debate, the question was taken on the amendment of
Mr. Sumner as modified, and resulted, Yeas 14, Nays 22. So the amendment
was lost.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>June 5th, at the next stage of the bill, Mr. Sumner moved his amendment
in the following form:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>And be it further enacted</i>, That every person claiming the service or labor
of any other person as a slave shall pay a tax of two dollars on account
of every person so claimed: but in no case shall any person so claimed be
sold for the purpose of collecting the tax.”</p>

</div>

<p>The yeas and nays were ordered, and, being taken, resulted, Yeas 19,
Nays 16. So the amendment was agreed to.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>June 6th, Mr. Anthony, of Rhode Island, who had voted for the tax
on slaves, moved a reconsideration, not because he had changed his
opinion, but, as he said, at the request of Senators. This was to give
an opportunity for another vote.</p>

<p>In the debate which ensued the amendment was assailed by Mr. Doolittle,
Mr. Browning, Mr. Cowan, and Mr. Hale. The latter quoted
the words,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“And if we cannot alter things,</div>
<div class="verse">Egad, we’ll change their names, Sir,”<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>&mdash;</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and insisted, that, however it might be called, it was a tax on slaves;
on which Mr. Wade remarked from his seat, “So much the better.”
Mr. Sumner said in reply:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;I presume there is no difference
among Senators in desire to follow the Constitution.
The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr.
<span class="smcap">Hale</span>], on my right, cannot be more desirous to follow
it than the Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. <span class="smcap">Wilmot</span>],
on my left. In that respect they are equal. Nor do I
believe that the Senator from Illinois [Mr. <span class="smcap">Browning</span>],
over the way, can claim any particular monopoly of
such devotion. In that respect, Sir, we are all equal.
Our difference is as to the meaning of the Constitution.
But it is a poor argument which finds its chief force
in asseverations of devotion to the Constitution. Conscious
of my obligation to support it, and of my loyalty,
I make no such asseverations.</p>

<p>Nor again, Sir, do I believe that the Senator from
New Hampshire can take to himself any monopoly of
praise for denying the whole offensive pretension of
property in man. Is he more earnest in this denial
than many other Senators? Is he more earnest than
the Senator from Pennsylvania near me? Is he more
earnest than myself? Has he denied it oftener in debate
or public speech? To me the pretension is absurd
as it is wicked. A man may as well claim property in
a star as in his fellow-man. And yet, Sir, with this
conviction, I cannot forget that I am here, as a Senator,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
to legislate with regard to existing institutions, and to
see things as they are. I cannot be blind to the <em>fact of
Slavery</em>. Slavery exists as a monstrous fact, an enormity,
if you please, but still it exists; and as a legislator
I am to act on its existence. Am I not right? Can
I presume on this occasion to be guided by my inner
conviction that there is no property in man, when, looking
to the Slave States, I am compelled to see the great,
unquestionable fact of pretended property? To my
mind, it is more practical to recognize the fact, and to
proceed accordingly.</p>

<p>The Senator from Illinois insists that this is a capitation
tax, and he reads the text of the Constitution.
What is a capitation tax? The precise definition in
Webster’s Dictionary&mdash;if the Senator will excuse me
for going to an authority which is not a law book&mdash;is
“a tax or imposition upon each head or person, a poll
tax.” Such is the tax with regard to which the provision
of the Constitution read by the Senator was adopted.
This provision is not applicable to any other tax, but
simply to this special tax.</p>

<p>Already I have reminded the Senator that he has
voted to tax auctioneers, to tax jugglers, to tax the
slaughterers of cattle, and to tax lawyers. I might add
other classes. I now propose that he should tax claimants
of slaves, a class offensive to reason and humanity.
That is all. If you look at the census of 1850,&mdash;that
of 1860 is not yet published,&mdash;you will find among the
different classes of our population the following: mariners,
70,000,&mdash;I will not give the hundreds; merchants,
100,000; planters, 27,000; wheelwrights, 30,000; teachers,
29,000; tailors, 52,000; overseers, 18,000; lawyers,
23,000; farmers, 2,363,000; slaveholders, 347,000.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, Sir, would any one say that a tax on the business
of the mariner was a capitation tax? Would any
one say that a tax on the business of merchants, of
whom we have one hundred thousand, was a capitation
tax? Would any one say that a tax on the business of
the planter was a capitation tax? that a tax on the
business of the wheelwright was a capitation tax? that
a tax on the business of teachers was a capitation tax?
that a tax on the business of tailors was a capitation
tax? that a tax on the business of overseers of plantations,
who apply the lash, of whom there are eighteen
thousand, was a capitation tax? that a tax on lawyers,
already voted by the Senator from Illinois, was a
capitation tax? that a tax on farmers, if you will, of
whom, happily, we have two million three hundred and
sixty-three thousand, was a capitation tax? And will
any one say that a tax on slave-masters, of whom, unhappily,
we have three hundred and forty-seven thousand,
is a capitation tax? Senators may imagine it a capitation
tax, Senators may call it a capitation tax, but no imagination
and no energy of assertion can make it so. It
is not a capitation tax. It is a tax on the claim of the
slave-master in the bones and muscles, the labor and
service of his fellow-man, and, so far as the tax can have
any influence, it must discredit and discourage such
claim. Therefore, Sir, I say confidently that the tax
is in every respect constitutional, and it is also a tax
well worthy of adoption, because, at a moment when
Slavery stands revealed as the very pest of our land,
it will operate to discredit and discourage it.</p>

<p>In no other way can you obtain so much revenue so
easily and so beneficently. But if you refuse to impose
this tax, you concede a special immunity to a most offensive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
pretension, and leave those who profit by it to
gather their profits without any of that burden so freely
imposed upon the honest industry of the country, and
upon so many classes of our citizens.</p>

<p>In the pressure of business before the Senate, it was proposed to sit

this proposition.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;If I recollect aright, the Tax
Bill was considered in the House of Representatives
more than three weeks, and it is well known that
there are rules for the limit of debate in that body
which do not prevail in the Senate.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Hale.</span> But which ought to prevail here.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> They do not prevail here, and we are
to take things as they are. Now, Sir, shall we limit
debate? Shall we cut it off more or less? In the absence
of rules by which it may be done, we are asked to
do it by protracting the daily session into the night, in
other words, by night sessions, and so hurrying the bill
to a final vote. I do not think this advisable. The
matters in question are too important for such summary
process. Each day has its debate on questions of detail,
which multiply as we proceed; but there are two
or three questions of principle not yet considered, though
already before us, including that opened yesterday by
the Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. <span class="smcap">Anthony</span>], and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
another to be presented by the Senator from California
[Mr. <span class="smcap">McDougall</span>], involving a review of different systems
of taxation. Is it supposed that such questions
can be properly considered in a single day, or in two
days, so that then we shall be ready to vote? To my
mind it is not possible.</p>

<p>But if possible, I repeat, it is not advisable, and, believe
me, Sir, I say this from no disposition to shirk
business or duty here. I have not been out of my seat
three minutes since this bill was taken up, nor, indeed,
have I been out of my seat a half-hour since the session
began. Therefore I do not fall under the judgment of
the Senator from Maine [Mr. <span class="smcap">Fessenden</span>] with regard
to those who prefer that debate should be allowed to
proceed, even at the expense of time. I am ready for
work; but I think we shall all do best, if this important
measure is considered without haste, if not entirely
without rest, according to the customary order of business.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>Hon. Edward Stanly was appointed by the President Provisional
Governor of North Carolina, and Andrew Johnson, of Tennessee. The
former signalized his arrival at his post by an official movement against
schools for colored children, as forbidden by “the laws of the State,”
meaning the Black Code, before the war.</p>

<p>Mr. Vincent Colyer, who had opened a school for colored children at
Newbern, came at once to Washington. Arriving at the close of the
day, he reported immediately to Mr. Sumner, who without delay hurried
to the Executive Mansion, and, not finding the President there,
followed him to the War Department. Mr. Sumner related what had
occurred, when the President, with an impatience which Mr. Sumner
never encountered from him on any other occasion, exclaimed, “Do
you take me for a School-Committee-man?” Mr. Sumner replied
promptly: “Not at all; I take you for President of the United States;
and I come with a case of wrong, in attending to which your predecessor,
George Washington, if alive, might add to his renown.” The
President changed his tone, and with perfect kindness proceeded to
consider the case.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner lost no time in laying it before the Senate.</p>

<p>June 2d, he offered the following resolution:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That the Secretary of War be requested to communicate to
the Senate copies of any commissions or orders from his Department undertaking
to appoint Provisional Governors in Tennessee and North Carolina,
with the instructions given to the Governors.”</p>

</div>

<p>By unanimous consent, the Senate proceeded to consider the resolution,
when Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;I shall not stop to consider
any question touching the power to appoint Governors
of States. My object is different. It is to expose
a case of peculiar interest and importance, with regard
to which I have a statement worthy of confidence.
From this it appears that one of the first acts of Mr.
Stanly, on arrival at Newbern, North Carolina, and assuming
his responsible duties as Provisional Governor,
was to announce that the school there for the education
of colored children, recently opened by Northern charity,
must be closed, being forbidden by the laws of
North Carolina, which he was instructed by the authorities
at Washington to maintain. I have here an official
report of this extraordinary transaction.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In a conversation between Governor Stanly and Mr.
Colyer, the Governor stated that there was one thing in Mr.
C.’s doings, as superintendent of the poor, a question would
be raised about,&mdash;indeed, it had been already,&mdash;and that
was his (C.’s) keeping school for the blacks. ‘Of course you
are aware,’ said the Governor, ‘that the laws of the State
make the opening of such schools a criminal offence. My
instructions from Washington were, that I was to carry out
the laws of North Carolina precisely as they were administered
before the breaking out of this unhappy affair; so,
if I were called upon for a decision in the matter of your
schools for the blacks, I would have to decide against you;
but at the same time I don’t want anything done abruptly.
As a man, I might do, perhaps, as you have done; but as a
Governor, I must act in my official capacity according to my
instructions, and administer the laws as I find them.’</p>

<p class="sig">“A true copy.</p>

<p class="sig2">“<span class="smcap">C. H. Mendell</span>,<br />
<i>Clerk to Mr. Colyer</i>.</p>

<p class="noindent medium">“<span class="smcap">Newbern</span>, May 28, 1862.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>Then follows a further statement.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Mr. C. C. Leigh, who was with General Saxton in the
Oriental, on his way to South Carolina, as confidential agent
of the National Freedmen’s Relief Association, and who has
just returned, asked Mr. Colyer what he should do. Mr.
C. replied: ‘I must close the schools, as I cannot consent to
continue to place myself in a situation where I am liable to
be punished according to the laws of North Carolina.’</p>

<p>“Mr. Leigh is the Chairman of our Home Committee.”</p>

</div>

<p>If any person, in the name of the United States, has
undertaken to close a school for little children, whether
white or black, it is important that we should know the
authority under which he assumes to act. Surely nobody
here will be willing to take the responsibility for
such an act. It is difficult to conceive that one of the
first fruits of national victory and the reëstablishment
of national power should be an enormity not easy to
characterize in any terms of moderation. Jefferson
tells us that in a certain contest there is no attribute
of the Almighty “which can take side with us.”<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> And
permit me to say, that, if, in the war unhappily existing,
the military power of the United States is employed in
closing schools, there is no attribute of the Almighty
which must not be against us; nor can we expect any
true success. Sir, in the name of the Constitution, of
humanity, and of common sense, I protest against such
impiety under sanction of the United States.</p>

<p>The proper rule of conduct is simple. It is found in
the instructions, to which I referred the other day, from
the British Commissioner in a conquered province of
India. After indicating certain crimes to be treated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
with summary punishment, he proceeds to say: “All
other crimes you will investigate according to the forms
of justice usual in the country, modified as you may
think expedient; and in all cases you will endeavor to
enforce the existing laws and customs, <em>unless where they
are clearly repugnant to reason and natural equity</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
Here is the proper limitation. Anything else is unworthy
of a civilized country. Whatever is clearly repugnant
to reason and equity must be rejected. Surely
such a thing cannot be enforced. But what can be more
clearly repugnant to reason and equity than the barbarous
law which an officer, in the name of the National
Government, has threatened to enforce?</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The resolution was agreed to.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>June 4th, a report from the Secretary of War, in answer to this resolution,
contained a letter of appointment, dated May 19, 1862, conferring
“all and singular the powers, duties, and functions pertaining
to the office of Military Governor, including the power to establish all
necessary offices and tribunals, and suspend the writ of <i>Habeas Corpus</i>.”
This was followed, May 20th, by instructions, wherein it is said: “Upon
your wisdom and energetic action much will depend.… It is not
deemed necessary to give any specific instruction, but rather to confide
in your sound discretion to adopt such measures as circumstances may
demand. Specific instructions will be given, when requested. You
may rely upon the perfect confidence and full support of the Department
in the performance of your duties.”<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right medium"><span class="smcap">Senate Chamber</span>, June 5, 1862.</p>

<p class="dropcap">MY DEAR SIR,&mdash;Your criticism of the President
is hasty. I am confident, if you knew him as I
do, you would not make it.</p>

<p>The President cannot be held responsible for the
misfeasance of subordinates, unless adopted, or at least
tolerated, by him. And I am sure nothing unjust or
ungenerous will be tolerated, much less adopted, by
him.</p>

<p>I am happy to let you know that he has no sympathy
with Stanly in his absurd wickedness, closing the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>schools, nor, again, in his other act of turning our camps
into a hunting-ground for slaves. He repudiates both,
positively. The latter point has occupied much of his
thought, and the newspapers do not go too far in recording
his repeated declarations, which I have often heard
from his own lips, that slaves finding their way within
the national lines are never to be reënslaved. This is
his conviction, expressed without reserve.</p>

<p>Could you&mdash;as has been my privilege often&mdash;have
seen the President, while considering the great questions
on which he has already acted, beginning with the invitation
to Emancipation in the States, then Emancipation
in the District of Columbia, and the acknowledgment
of the Independence of Hayti and Liberia, even your
zeal would be satisfied; for you would feel the sincerity
of his purpose to do what he can to carry forward the
principles of the Declaration of Independence. His
whole soul was occupied, especially by the first proposition,
so peculiarly his own. In familiar intercourse
with him, I remember nothing more touching than the
earnestness and completeness with which he embraced
this idea. To his mind it was just and beneficent, while
it promised the sure end of Slavery. To me, who had
already proposed a Bridge of Gold for the retreating
Fiend, it was most welcome. Proceeding from the President,
it must take its place among the great events of
history.</p>

<p>If disposed to be impatient at apparent short-comings,
think, I pray you, what has been done in a brief
period, and from the past discern the sure promise
of the future. Knowing something of my convictions,
and of the ardor with which I maintain them, you may,
perhaps, derive assurance from my confidence. I say to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
you, therefore, Stand by the Administration. If need be,
help it by word and act; but stand by it, and have faith
in it.</p>

<p>I wish that you knew the President, and had heard
the artless expression of his convictions on those questions
which concern you so deeply. You might, perhaps,
wish he were less cautious, but you would be
grateful that he is so true to all you have at heart.
Believe me, therefore, you are wrong; and I regret it
the more because of my desire to see all our friends
stand firm together.</p>

<p>If I write strongly, it is because I feel strongly; for
my constant and intimate intercourse with the President,
beginning with the fourth of March, not only binds
me peculiarly to his Administration, but gives me a personal
as well as a political interest in seeing that justice
is done him.</p>

<p>Further report from North Carolina induced Mr. Sumner again to
bring the action of Mr. Stanly before the Senate, in the hope especially
of reaching the country, and also the Administration.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Whereas Edward Stanly, assuming to act under
a letter from the Secretary of War, calling
him Military Governor of North Carolina, a post unknown
to the Constitution and laws of the Union, has
undertaken, by virtue of such military authority, to
surrender fugitive slaves, contrary to the intent and
meaning of an Act of Congress recently adopted; also
to banish an American citizen, in violation of personal
rights secured by the Constitution; and also to close
and suppress schools maintained by the charity of good
men for the education of colored children, in defiance of
every principle of morals and religion, and to the discredit
of our national character: Therefore,&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>Resolved</i>, That the President of the United States
be requested to cancel the letter of the Secretary of
War under which Edward Stanly now assumes to act.</p>

any person Military Governor of a State, is without
sanction in the Constitution and laws, and that its effect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
is to subordinate the civil to the military authority,

</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>The facts essential to the comprehension of this case appear in the
debate.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;The question is on the admission
of West Virginia into the Union as a new
State, and the following is one of the conditions, namely:
“That from and after the fourth day of July, 1863,
the children of all slaves born within the limits of said
State shall be free.” Here is a condition which you
undertake to impose. This is clear.</p>

<p>But, Sir, be good enough to observe that this condition
recognizes Slavery during the present generation.
Short as life may be, it is too long for Slavery. If it be
adopted, and the bill becomes a law, a new Slave State
will take its place in our Union,&mdash;it may be with but
few slaves, and for the present generation only, but nevertheless
a new Slave State. That, Sir, is too much.</p>

<p>How often have I said, and how painful that I must
now repeat what all know, that it takes but little Slavery
to make a Slave State with all the virus of Slavery!
Now my vote shall help no new State to take a place
in this Union, with Senators in this body, unless purged
of this poison. Enough has our nation been disturbed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
and enough has the Constitution been perverted. The
time has come for the remedy. It is found in the
policy of Thomas Jefferson, originally applied to the
great Territory of the Northwest. Its application to a
portion of his own Virginia, seeking to become a new
State, will be politic, just, and conservative.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Sumner concluded by moving to strike out the words of the condition
proposed, and insert an absolute abolition and prohibition, so
that it should read, “From and after the fourth day of July, 1863,
within the limits of the State there shall be neither slavery nor involuntary
servitude, otherwise than in the punishment of crime whereof
the party shall be duly convicted.”</p>

<p>July 1st, the Senate proceeded to the consideration of the bill, the
pending question being the amendment of Mr. Sumner, who made the
following remarks.</p>

</div>

<p>Time has elapsed since this measure was before the
Senate, which meanwhile has been engaged in an important
debate. Therefore I shall be pardoned, if, at
the expense of repetition, I recall attention to the precise
question.</p>

<p>The bill for the admission of West Virginia provides
that from and after the 4th of July, 1863, all children
born of slaves shall be free, leaving the existing generation
in Slavery. From statistics furnished by the
honorable Senator from Virginia [Mr. <span class="smcap">Willey</span>], in his
elaborate speech, it appears that in West Virginia twelve
thousand human beings are held in Slavery.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Willey.</span> That was in 1860; but it is not so now.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> There may be fewer now: call the
number ten thousand. There are ten thousand slaves
there, who, according to the bill, are to remain in bondage
during life. Thus, for one whole generation, shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
we be afflicted by another Slave State, with two slaveholding
representatives in this body.</p>

<p>I mean to speak of this question with all possible respect
for Senators on the other side. I am anxious not
to introduce any topic otherwise than agreeable; but I
must discharge my duty here. I cannot by my vote
consent that there shall be two additional slaveholding
Senators for another generation. I content myself with
this declaration, without argument,&mdash;except what is
found in a brief passage by Mr. Webster in this body. I
refer to his speech of the 22d of December, 1845, on the
admission of Texas, where he used this language:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In the next place, Sir, I have to say, that, while I hold,
with as much integrity, I trust, and faithfulness, as any citizen
of this country, to all the original arrangements and
compromises under which the Constitution under which we
now live was adopted, I never could, and never can, persuade
myself to be in favor of the admission of other States into
the Union as Slave States, with the inequalities which were
allowed and accorded by the Constitution to the slaveholding
States then in existence. I do not think that the Free
States ever expected, or could expect, that they would be
called on to admit more Slave States, having the unequal
advantages arising to them from the mode of apportioning
representation under the existing Constitution.…</p>

<p>“It will always be a question, whether the other States
have not a right (and I think they have the clearest right)
to require that the State coming into the Union should come
in upon an equality; and if the existence of Slavery be an
impediment to coming in on an equality, then the State proposing
to come in should be required to remove that inequality
by abolishing Slavery, or take the alternative of
being excluded.”<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>Afterwards, in his famous speech of the 7th of March,
1850, he reaffirmed these principles.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It has happened that between 1837 and this time, on
various occasions, I have expressed my entire opposition to
the admission of Slave States, or the acquisition of new
Slave Territories, to be added to the United States. I
know, Sir, no change in my own sentiments or my own
purposes in that respect.”<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

</div>

<p>I might quote more, but this is sufficient. Mr. Webster
was against new Slave States.</p>

<p>I adduce these words as stating strongly at least one
important ground of objection. The admission of West
Virginia with a condition recognizing Slavery for a full
generation will be an extension of the Slave Power and
a new sanction of Slavery. I cannot consent to it, Sir;
nor do I see any apology for hesitation. Our control of
this matter is clear beyond reasonable doubt, and the
present state of our country supplies a new motive for
its exercise.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>In the debate that ensued, Mr. Hale criticized Mr. Sumner, quoting
the story of Abraham and his aged idolatrous guest, as given by Dr.
Franklin.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“‘And God said to Abraham, Have I borne with you [him] these fourscore
years, and canst thou not bear with him one night, who art thyself a sinner?’
Sir, in exactly the spirit inculcated by that fable I would deal with Slavery;
and I would listen to-day as it were to the voice of God, who asks us, Have
I borne with this thing so many generations, and cannot you bear with it
dying, when it begins on the next Fourth of July?”<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>
<p>Mr. Wade, in the same spirit, said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“My friend from Massachusetts, by his proposition, strikes this institution
down at one dash. I should like to see it go; but I must look a little to see
what its effect will be, after all.”<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Before the vote was taken, Mr. Carlile, of Virginia, remarked:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Mr. President, it is my sincere belief that this disposition to interfere
with the rights of the States, exhibited by this Congress, has prolonged the
war,&mdash;that, if persisted in, the war becomes a war of indefinite duration, and
that the Constitutional Union our fathers formed will be lost to us and our
posterity forever.”<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

</div>

<p>July 14th, the question was taken on Mr. Sumner’s amendment,
which was rejected,&mdash;Yeas 11, Nays 24.</p>

<p>Mr. Lane, of Kansas, moved that all slaves in the State, July 4, 1863,
and under the age of ten, shall be free when they arrive at the age of
twenty-one, and all slaves over ten and under twenty-one shall be free
when they arrive at the age of twenty-five; and the amendment was
adopted,&mdash;Yeas 25, Nays 12.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The question then occurred on the passage of the bill, when Mr.
Sumner remarked:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>I renounce the intention of presenting again the
amendment you have already voted down; but it is
none the less important in my judgment. I do not
like to occupy the time of the Senate; but I cannot
doubt that you have acted on the amendment hastily,
and without full consideration. Why, Sir, it is simply
the old Jeffersonian ordinance, which, when originally
adopted for the great Territory of the Northwest, operated
upon Slavery already there, and absolutely forbade
this wrong from that time forward. In point of fact,
slaves were freed by this ordinance.</p>

<p>I thought it well that this institute of Virginia’s son
should help to redeem Virginia. It has been voted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
down; and now the question is presented, whether the
Senate will recognize a new Slave State. True, Slavery
will be for a short term only, for twenty-one years, if
you please, but that is a long time for Slavery. I cannot
consent to admit a new State with such a curse for
twenty-one years. How little slavery it takes to make
a Slave State is illustrated by Delaware, with less than
eighteen hundred slaves, sending two Senators of Slavery
to this Chamber. Shall we welcome two more
from a State newly created by ourselves? Never, Sir,
by my vote; and as the Senate sees fit to discard the
effort I have made, I deem it my duty to vote against
the bill.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The New York <i>Independent</i> published it at length, and thus characterized
it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is the most complete presentation of the question that can be found
within the same compass, and, like all Mr. Sumner’s speeches, is distinguished
for accuracy of statement, learning, and sound principle. It is a
defence of the present position of our Government, as defined by Act of Congress,
to which every citizen owes obedience. In efficacy, that Act will go
with our armies, as they advance, and will clear up the perplexities of our
Generals, and clear their minds of certain political superstitions by which
they have been hampered and hindered, to the great injury of our military
operations. Let the people of Massachusetts, in particular, exult, as they
observe, in regard to this, as well as most other leading measures of Congress,
how the views of their great Senator became, step by step, the recognized
and settled policy of the Government; and let them thank God that the good
old Bay State has such a representative, and furnishes such a leader in this
great extremity.”</p>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;Too tardily the house of a
Rebel General in Virginia<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> has been taken by
the Government, and set apart as a military hospital
for the reception of our soldiers, wounded and maimed
in battle. At least three churches here in Washington
have been seized and occupied for the same purpose.
All applaud these acts, which make the house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
more historic and the churches more sacred than ever
before. But pray, Sir, under what authority is all this?
Not according to any contract or agreement; not according
to any “due process of law”; not even according
to any statute. And yet the language of the
Constitution is positive: “No soldier shall in time of
peace be quartered <em>in any house</em>, without the consent
of the owner; nor in time of war, but in a manner to be
prescribed by law.” If it be time of peace now, then is
the Constitution violated by quartering soldiers in these
houses without the consent of the owner. If it be time
of war now, then is the Constitution violated by quartering
these soldiers in a manner not prescribed by law,&mdash;unless
we are ready to admit that the provisions of
the Constitution are entirely inapplicable to what is
done under the military requirements of self-defence,
which is a supreme law, above all other laws or constitutions
devised by men. But if the Constitution,
in a case where it is singularly explicit, can be disregarded
without question in the exercise of the Rights
of War, it is vain to invoke its provisions in other
cases, where it is less explicit, in restraint of the Rights
of War.</p>

<p>It is true that the Constitution ambiguously provides
against certain forfeitures, as incident to an “attainder
of treason”; it also positively prohibits “<i>ex post facto</i>
laws”; and it nobly declares that “no person shall be
deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process
of law.” But nothing in the House bills for the
confiscation of property or the liberation of slaves is
obnoxious to either of these provisions. There is no
attainder of treason, no <i>ex post facto</i> law, and no taking
of property without due process of law; for the judi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>cial
proceedings which these bills institute are competent
for the purpose. The House bills are not criminal
statutes, nor do they institute criminal proceedings.
Therefore do I assert unhesitatingly that these bills are
above constitutional objection. They are as constitutional
as the Constitution itself. It was once said of a
subtile spirit of criticism, that it would find a heresy
in the Lord’s Prayer; and such a spirit, permit me to
say, is needed to find anything unconstitutional in these
bills.</p>

<p>Here I assume, as a cardinal principle of Constitutional
Law, that, whatever may be the condition of
slaves in the States and under State laws, they are,
under the Constitution of the United States, <em>persons</em>,
and not property; so that, in declaring their emancipation,
Congress is not constrained by any constitutional
requirements with regard to property. Whatever the
claims of property, slaves are men; and I but repeat
an unquestionable truth of morals, confirmed by the
Declaration of Independence, when I say that there
can be no property in men. Mr. Winter Davis,<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> of
Baltimore, has reminded the country, that Congress, on
the motion of Mr. Clay, once undertook to declare the
freedom of slaves without any “due process of law”;
and the present Congress, by a bill of the last session,
setting free slaves actually employed in the Rebellion,<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
has done the same thing; so that the principle is completely
established.</p>

<p>Even if the bills seemed obnoxious to certain constitutional
provisions,&mdash;as they clearly are not,&mdash;this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>objection and every other objection will disappear, when
it is understood that they are <em>war measures</em>, derived
from the capacious War Powers of Congress, applicable
only to public enemies, and limited in duration to the
war. Considered in these aspects and with these qualifications,
these bills are only an agency in the prosecution
of the war, and the power to enact them is as
clear as the power to raise armies or to levy taxes. An
ancient historian, in words adopted by the greatest
modern publicist, has told us that “war has its laws,
no less than peace.”<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> These words are placed by
Grotius at the head of his great work, and they embody
a fundamental principle. The Rights of War are not
less peculiar than the victories of war, which are so
widely different from the victories of peace.</p>

<p>Pray, Sir, where in the Constitution is any limitation
of the War Powers? Let Senators who would
limit them mention a single section, line, or phrase,
which even hints at any limitation. If it be constitutional
to make war, to set armies in the field, to launch
navies, to occupy fields and houses, to bombard cities,
to kill in battle,&mdash;all without trial by jury, or any process
of law, or judicial proceeding of any kind,&mdash;it is
equally constitutional, as a war measure, to confiscate
the property of the enemy and to liberate his slaves.
Nor can it be doubted on principle, that, if the latter
be unconstitutional, then are all other acts of war
unconstitutional. You may condemn confiscation and
liberation as impolitic, but you cannot condemn them
as unconstitutional, unless, in the same breath, you condemn
all other agencies of war, and resolve our present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
proceeding into the process of a criminal court, guarded
at each step by the technicalities of the Common Law.</p>

<p>Sir, I speak frankly, according to my convictions,
claiming nothing for myself which I do not freely accord
to others. In this discussion there is no need of
sharp words or of personal allusions; nor can anything
be gained by misstatement of the position of another.
It is easy to say that Senators who insist upon the War
Powers of Congress are indifferent to the Constitution;
but I do not admit that any Senator is more anxious
for the Constitution than myself. The War Powers are
derived from the Constitution, but, when once set in
motion, are without any restraint from the Constitution;
so that what is done in pursuance of them is at
the same time <em>under</em> the Constitution and <em>outside</em> the
Constitution. It is under the Constitution in its beginning
and origin; it is outside the Constitution in
the latitude with which it is conducted; but, whether
under the Constitution or outside the Constitution, all
that is done in pursuance of the War Powers is constitutional.
It is easy to cry out against it; it is easy, by
misapplication of the Constitution, to call it in question;
but it is only by such misapplication, or by senseless
cry, that its complete constitutionality can for a
moment be drawn into doubt.</p>

<p>The language of the Constitution is plain and ample.
It confers upon Congress all the specific powers incident
to war, and then further authorizes it “to make
all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying
into execution the foregoing powers.” Here are
the precise words:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Congress shall have power … to declare war, grant
letters of marque and reprisal, and make rules concerning
captures on land and water; to raise and support armies; …
to provide and maintain a navy; to make rules for the government
and regulation of the land and naval forces; to
provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of
the Union, suppress insurrections, and repel invasions; …
<em>to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for
carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers
vested by this Constitution</em> in the Government of the
United States, or in any department <em>or officer thereof</em>.”</p>

</div>

<p>Can language be clearer? Other parts of the Constitution
may be open to question; but here is no room for
question. The text is full and unequivocal. The powers
are enumerated. Without stopping to consider
them in detail, it will be seen that the most important
are exclusively incident to a state of war, and not to a
state of peace. A declaration of war is of course war,
and “all laws necessary and proper for carrying into
execution” this declaration are called into being by the
war. Rules concerning captures on land and water
are from necessity dormant, till aroused by war; but
when aroused, they are, like other War Powers, without
check from those constitutional provisions which, just
so long as peace prevails, are the boast of the citizen.</p>

<p>The War Powers conferred upon Congress by the
Constitution were well known; they had been conferred
upon Congress by the earlier Articles of Confederation.
The language of the latter was full and
explicit with regard to captures.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The United States in Congress assembled shall have
the sole and exclusive right and power of determining on
peace and war, … of establishing rules for deciding in
all cases <em>what captures on land or water shall be legal</em>, and in
what manner prizes taken by land or naval forces in th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>e service
of the United States shall be divided or appropriated,
… and establishing courts for receiving and determining
finally <em>appeals in all cases of captures</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The language subsequently employed in the Constitution
is identical in substance. It is evident that the
framers of the Constitution had the Articles of Confederation
in mind, when they vested in Congress power to
“make rules concerning captures on land and water.”</p>

<p>The bills now under consideration are obviously
founded on the War Powers. The first section of the
first bill begins as follows.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That all the estate and property, money, stocks, credits,
and effects of the persons hereafter named in this section
are hereby forfeited to the Government of the United States,
<em>and are declared lawful subjects of seizure, and of prize and
capture, wherever found, for the indemnity of the United States
against the expenses of suppressing the present Rebellion</em>.”</p>

</div>

<p>The Senator must be very hardy who denies the
power of Congress, in the exercise of belligerent rights,
to pass such a bill; and he must be equally hardy, when
he insists that belligerent rights are impaired by any
limitations of the Constitution.</p>

<p>If the enemies against whom we now wage war
were not our own fellow-citizens, if they were aliens
unhappily fastened for the time on our territory, there
would be no fine-spun question of constitutional immunity.
Such immunities are essentially municipal in
character; but a public enemy can claim nothing merely
municipal. The immunities he enjoys are such only
as are conceded by the Rights of War,&mdash;nor more, nor
less. As a public enemy, he seeks to subvert our Government,
its laws and its Constitution; and in this warfare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
he proceeds according to the Rights of War, indifferent
to any mere local law. But if the war on our
part were in accordance with mere local law, and in
subordination to provisions of the Constitution devised
for peace, it is evident that the National Government
would be unable to cope with its enemy. It would
enter into battle with hands tied behind the back. Of
course, in warfare with people of another country Senators
would not require any such self-sacrifice.</p>

<p>But the Rights of War are fixed, whether against
alien enemies or against enemies whose hostility is aggravated
by the guilt of rebellion, with this single difference,
that against rebel enemies these rights would
seem to be more complete and unsparing. Show me
any Right of War which may be employed against alien
enemies, and now, in the name of the Constitution, I
insist upon its employment against rebels arrayed as
enemies. Because enemies are also rebels, they are not
on this account any the less enemies. Because rebels
are also enemies, they are not on this account any the
less rebels. The double character which they bear increases
their liabilities, subjecting them to all the penalties
of war enhanced by those personal responsibilities
which every partaker in rebellion necessarily assumes.</p>

<p>And yet, Sir, the Constitution is cited as a limitation
upon these rights. As well cite the Constitution on the
field of battle to check the bayonet charge of our armies,
or at the bombardment of a fortress to stay the fiery
rain of shells; or, to adopt the examples with which I
began, as well cite the Constitution to prevent the occupation
of churches here in Washington as hospitals for
our soldiers, or to save the house of General Lee in Virginia
from similar dedication. The Constitution is en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>tirely
inapplicable. Sacred and inviolable, the Constitution
is made for friends who acknowledge it, and not
for enemies who disavow it; and it is made for a state
of peace, and not for the fearful exigencies of war, treading
down within its sphere all rights except the Rights
of War. Born of violence, and looking to violence for
victory, war discards all limitations except such as are
supplied by the Rights of War. Once begun, war is a
law unto itself,&mdash;or, in other words, it has a law of its
own, which is part of itself. And just in proportion as
you seek to moderate it by constitutional limitations do
you take from war something of its efficiency. In vain
do you equip our soldiers with the best of weapons, or
send into the field the most powerful batteries, the latest
invention of consummate science, if you direct them
all in full career to stand still for an indictment, or other
“due process of law,” or, at least, for the reading of the
Riot Act. Undertaking to limit the Rights of War
by the Constitution, where are you to stop? If the
Constitution can interfere with one, it can interfere
with all. If the Constitution can wrest from Government
the weapons of confiscation and liberation, there
is no other weapon in the whole arsenal of war which
it may not take also.</p>

<p>Sir, the Constitution is guilty of no such absurdity.
It was made by practical men, familiar with public law,
who, seeing clearly the difference between peace and
war, established powers accordingly. While circumscribing
the Peace Powers with constitutional checks,
they left untouched the War Powers. They declared,
that, in the administration of the Peace Powers, all
should be able to invoke the Constitution as a constant
safeguard. But in bestowing upon the Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
War Powers without limitation, they embodied in the
Constitution all the Rights of War as completely as
if those rights had been severally set down and enumerated;
and among the first of these is the right to
disregard the Rights of Peace. In saying this I fail
in no sympathy with peace, which I seek and reverence
always, but simply exhibit war in some of its essential
conditions. Sir, an alien enemy is not admitted
even to sue in your courts.</p>

<p>There is a saying of Antiquity, already quoted in this
debate, <i>Silent leges inter arma</i>,&mdash;“The laws are silent in
the midst of arms.”<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> Handed down from distant ages,
and repeated by successive generations, this saying may
be accepted as the embodied result and very essence of
human experience. Had it not been true, it would have
been forgotten, or at least ceased to be repeated. But
it declares a truth to which every war practically testifies,
while it is founded in reason and the nature of
things, confirmed by centuries as attesting witnesses.
The Constitution itself is only a human law; nor can
it claim to speak in time of war, and within the sphere
of war, more than any other human law.</p>

<p>How vain, then, to adduce against confiscation and
liberation, as war measures, an objection derived from
the Constitution! and how vain, also, to offer a penal
statute, under the Peace Powers of the Constitution, as
a war measure! War is war. Better arrest it at once,
if it is to be war on the one side and peace on the other,&mdash;if
our enemies are to employ against us all the Rights
of War, while we employ against them only the Rights
of Peace. Penal statutes are good for peace, when laws
prevail; but in the midst of war, and against enemie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>s,
when laws are proverbially silent, they are absurd.
What enemy now arrayed in arms can be indicted, or,
if indicted, convicted, under the most stringent of penal
statutes? Not Jefferson Davis himself. Why, then,
painfully construct legislative verbiage? Why new
penalties for treason, which, from the nature of the
case, cannot be enforced in this hour of need? Why
not see things as they are, and do what the moment
requires? The War Powers of Congress are ample;
but in time of war a mere penal statute against a
public enemy is not so much as a pop-gun.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There are Senators who claim these vast War Powers
for the President, and deny them to Congress. The
President, it is said, as commander-in-chief, may seize,
confiscate, and liberate under the Rights of War, but
Congress cannot direct these things to be done. Pray,
Sir, where is the limitation upon Congress? Read the
text of the Constitution, and you will find its powers
vast as all the requirements of war. There is nothing
that may be done anywhere under the Rights of War,
which may not be done by Congress. I do not mean
to question the powers of the President in his sphere,
or of any military commander within his department;
but I claim for Congress all that belongs to any Government
in the exercise of the Rights of War. And
when I speak of Congress, let it be understood that I
mean <em>an Act of Congress</em>, passed, according to the requirements
of the Constitution, by both Houses, and approved
by the President. It seems strange to claim for
the President alone, in the exercise of his single will,
War Powers alleged to be denied to the President in
association with Congress. If he can wield these powers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
alone, surely he can wield them in association with
Congress; nor will their efficacy be impaired, when it
is known that they proceed from this associate will,
rather than from his single will alone. The Government
of the United States appears most completely in
an Act of Congress. Therefore war is declared, armies
are raised, rules concerning captures are made, and all
articles of war regulating the conduct of war are established
by Act of Congress. It is by Act of Congress
that the War Powers are all put in motion. When once
put in motion, the President must execute them. But
he is only the instrument of Congress, under the Constitution.</p>

<p>It is true, the President is commander-in-chief; but
it is for Congress to make all laws necessary and proper
for carrying into execution his powers, so that, according
to the very words of the Constitution, his powers depend
upon Congress, which may limit or enlarge them at its
own pleasure. Thus, whether you regard Congress or
regard the President, you will find that Congress is the
arbiter and regulator of the War Powers.</p>

<p>Of the pretension that all these enormous powers belong
to the President, and not to Congress, I try to speak
calmly and within bounds. I mean always to be parliamentary.
But a pretension so irrational and unconstitutional,
so absurd and tyrannical, is not entitled to
respect. The Senator from Ohio [Mr. <span class="smcap">Wade</span>], in indignant
words worthy of the Senate, has branded it as slavish,
and handed it over to judgment. Born in ignorance,
and pernicious in consequences, it ought to be received
most sternly, and, just in proportion as it obtains acceptance,
with execration. Such a pretension would
change the National Government from a government of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
law to that of a military dictator. It would degrade our
proud Constitutional Republic, where each department
has its appointed place, to one of those short-lived, vulgar
despotisms appearing occasionally as a warning to mankind.
That this pretension should be put forward in
the name of the Constitution is only another illustration
of the effrontery with which the Constitution is made
responsible for the ignorance, the conceit, and the passions
of men. Sir, in the name of the Constitution,
which I have sworn to support, and which, according
to my ability, I mean to maintain, I protest against this
new-fangled effort to foist into it a pretension abhorrent
to liberty, reason, and common sense.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At the risk of repetition, but for the sake of clearness,
I repeat the propositions on which I confidently rest.</p>

<p>1. Rights of Sovereignty are derived from the Constitution,
and can be exercised only in conformity with
the requirements of the Constitution; so that all penal
statutes punishing treason must carefully comply with
these requirements. This is the case of the bill introduced
by the Senator from New Hampshire [Mr.
<span class="smcap">Clark</span>].</p>

<p>2. Rights of War are under the Constitution in their
origin, but outside the Constitution in their execution.
In other words, the Constitution confers Rights of War,
but sets no limits to them; so that statutes to enforce
them are not mere penal statutes, restricted by the Constitution.
But these rights belong to a state of war, and
necessarily cease with the war. This is the case of the
House bill under discussion.</p>

<p>3. All rebels are criminals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span> liable to punishment according
to penal statutes; and in all proceedings against
them, as such, they are surrounded by the safeguards of
the Constitution.</p>

<p>4. Rebels in arms are public enemies, who can claim
no safeguard from the Constitution; and they may be
pursued and conquered according to the Rights of War.</p>

<p>5. Rights of War may be enforced by Act of Congress,
which is the highest form of the national will.</p>

<p>If these conclusions needed the support of authority,
they would find it in John Quincy Adams. His words
have been often quoted, without perhaps fully considering
the great weight to which they are entitled. At an
early day, when Minister at London, while Slavery prevailed
in the Government, in the discharge of official
duties, under instructions from the President, he claimed
compensation for slaves liberated by the British armies,
arguing against any such liberation under the Rights of
War. In conversation with the British Prime-Minister,
as reported by himself, after saying that proclamations
inviting slaves to desert from their masters had been
issued by British officers, he added: “<em>We</em> considered
them as deviations from the usages of war.”<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> Afterwards,
as Secretary of State under Mr. Monroe, of Virginia,
he made a similar statement.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> A full knowledge
of his convictions on this occasion might, perhaps, disclose
the repugnance, or, to borrow his own words on
another occasion, “the bitterness of soul,” with which
he discharged his duty. It is known, by avowal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>s afterwards
made, that on at least one occasion he acted as
Secretary of State contrary to his convictions. “It was
utterly against my judgment and wishes, but I was
obliged to submit, and I prepared the requisite despatches.”<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
Such was his open declaration in the
House of Representatives with regard to an important
negotiation. So that it is easy to see how on this other
occasion he may have represented the Government and
not himself. But, whatever his actions at that time, it
is beyond question, that afterwards, in his glorious career
as Representative, when larger experience and still
maturer years had added to his great authority, and he
was called in Congress to express himself on his personal
responsibility, we find him reconsidering his earlier
diplomatic arguments, and, in the face of the world,
defiantly claiming not only for Congress, but for the
President, and every military commander within his
department, full power to emancipate slaves under the
Rights of War. If these words had been hastily uttered,
or, if once uttered, had been afterwards abandoned,
or if they could in any way be associated with
the passions or ardors of controversy, as his earlier
words were clearly associated with the duties of advocacy,
they might be entitled to less consideration. But
they are among the later and most memorable utterances
of our great master of the Law of Nations, made
under circumstances of peculiar solemnity, and repeated
after intervals of time.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p class="center">…</p>

<p>The re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>presentatives of Slavery broke forth in characteristic
outrage upon the venerable orator, but nobody
answered him. And these words have stood ever since
as a landmark of public law. You cannot deny the power
of Congress to liberate the slaves, without removing
this landmark. Vain work! It is not less firm than
the Constitution itself.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thus do I vindicate for Congress all the Rights of
War. If, assuming the powers of Congress, any further
question be raised as to the extent of these rights, I
reply, briefly, that there is no right, according to received
authorities, against a hostile sovereign or prince,
embracing, of course, confiscation of property, real as
well as personal, which may not in our discretion be
exercised against a rebel enemy; and the reason is
obvious. Whatever the mitigations of the Rights of
War introduced by modern civilization, under which
private property in certain cases is exempt from confiscation,
<em>this rule does not apply to cases where there is
a direct personal responsibility for the war</em>. And here
is the precise difference between the responsibility of
the sovereign or prince and the responsibility of the
private citizen: the private citizen is excused; but the
sovereign or prince is always held responsible to the
full extent of his property, real as well as personal.
Now every rebel who has voluntarily become a public
enemy has assumed a <em>personal responsibility</em>, for which,
according to acknowledged principles of public law,
especially if he has taken high office in the rebel government,
he is liable to the full extent of his property,
real as well as personal. Every citizen who voluntarily
aids in armed rebellion is a hostile sovereign or prince.
A generous lenity may interfere to limit his liability,
but on principles of public law he is in the very conditi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>on
of Shylock, when his cruelty was arrested by the
righteous judge:&mdash;</p>

<div class="verse">Unto the State of Venice.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Such, Sir, is the extent of powers which may be
exercised by Congress. Of course, it is for Congress
to determine the degree of severity or lenity it will
adopt. In claiming these powers to the full extent, I
yield to no Senator in that spirit of clemency which,
next to justice, is the grace and ornament of success.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. President, these are the principles on which we
must act. Announcing them and reducing them to
practice, Congress will enlarge its accumulating claims
to public gratitude.</p>

<p>The present Congress has already done much beyond
any other Congress in our history. Measures, which for
long years seemed attainable only to the most sanguine
hope, have triumphed. Emancipation in the National
Capital; freedom in all the National Territories; the
offer of ransom to help emancipation in the States;
the recognition of Hayti and Liberia; the treaty with
Great Britain for the suppression of the slave-trade;
the prohibition of the return of fugitive slaves by military
officers; homesteads for actual settlers on the public
lands; a Pacific railroad; endowments of agricultural
colleges out of the public lands: such are some of the
achievements by which the present Congress is already
historic. There have been victories of war, won on
hard-fought fields, but none comparable to the victories
of peace. Besides these measures of unmixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
beneficence, the present Congress has created an immense
army and a considerable navy, and has provided
the means for all our gigantic expenditures by
a tax, which in itself is an epoch.</p>

<p>Thus, in the prosecution of the war, Congress has exercised
two great powers,&mdash;first, to raise armies, and,
secondly, to tax. Both bear directly upon loyal fellow-citizens
everywhere throughout the country. Sons,
brothers, and husbands are taken from happy homes
and from the concerns of business, leaving vacant places,
never, perhaps, to be filled again, and hurried away
to wage a fearful war. But beyond this unequalled
draft upon the loyal men of the country, summoning
them to the hazards of battle, there is another unequalled
draft upon the loyal property of the country,
presenting a combined draft without precedent upon
men and upon property. If you would find a parallel
to the armies raised, you must go back to the forces
marshalled under Napoleon in the indulgence of unbridled
ambition. If you would find a parallel to the
tax, you must go further back, to that early day of
which the Gospel, in its simple narrative, speaks:
“And it came to pass in those days that there went
out a decree from Cæsar Augustus, that <em>all the world</em>
should be taxed.” A similar decree is about to go
out from you,&mdash;not, indeed, to tax all the world, but
to tax a large and generous people: vast, it may be,
even for the world. There have been taxes here before;
and in other countries there have been taxes
as enormous: but there has been no such tax here
before; and in no other country has any such tax been
levied at once, without the preparation and education
of long-continued taxation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Confiscation and liberation are other War Powers of
Congress, incident to the general grant of such powers,
which it remains for us to employ. So important
are they, that without them I fear all the rest
will be in vain. Yes, Sir, in vain do we gather mighty
armies, and in vain do we tax our people, unless we
are ready to grasp these other means, through which
the war can be carried to the homes of the Rebellion:
I mean especially the criminal homes of the authors
and leaders of all this wickedness. By the confiscation
of property, the large Rebel estates, where treason
laid its eggs, will be broken up, while by the liberation
of slaves the Rebels will be deprived of an invaluable
ally, whether in labor or in battle. But I confess
frankly that I look with more hope and confidence to
liberation than to confiscation. To give freedom is
nobler than to take property, and on this occasion it
cannot fail to be more efficacious, for in this way the
rear-guard of the Rebellion will be changed into the
advance-guard of the Union. There is in confiscation,
unless when directed against the criminal authors of
the Rebellion, a harshness inconsistent with that mercy
which it is always a sacred duty to cultivate, and which
should be manifest in proportion to our triumphs,
“mightiest in the mightiest.” But liberation is not
harsh, and it is certain, if properly conducted, to carry
with it the smiles of a benignant Providence.</p>

<p>The war began in Slavery, and it can end only with
the end of Slavery. It was set in motion and organized
by the Slave Oligarchy, and it cannot die except with
this accursed Oligarchy. Therefore, for the sake of
peace, and to restore the Union, every power should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
be enlisted by which Slavery, which is the soul of
the war, can be reached. Are you in earnest? Then
strike at Slavery. Liberation is usually known as a
charity; but while none the less a charity, comprehending
all other charities, it is now, in the course of
events, <em>a necessity of war</em>. Through liberation alone
can we obtain that complete triumph, bringing with it
assured tranquillity, without which the war will stop
merely to break forth anew, and peace will be nothing
but an uneasy truce. Among all the powers of Congress
incident to our unparalleled condition, there is
none so far-reaching, as there is none so beneficent,&mdash;there
is none so potent to beat down rebellion, as there
is none other by which peace can be made truly secure.
Powerful and beautiful prerogative! The language of
Chatham is not misapplied, when I call it the “master
feather of the eagle’s wing.”</p>

<p>The pending bill, providing that property taken by the Rebels and
then retaken under national authority should be restored to the former
loyal owner without salvage, was opposed by Mr. Grimes.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">I take it that the policy of prize-money is always
open to question. It has been handed down from
other generations, but I cannot doubt, that, in proportion
as nations advance in civilization and refinement, it is
more and more drawn into doubt.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Grimes.</span> I will ask the Senator, whether, under the
law as it now exists, our officers and sailors have not certain
vested rights? This bill is retrospective, as well as prospective.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> But these vested rights, according to
existing law, are acquired in war with foreign enemies.
And here is the precise point of principle. Certain
property of fellow-citizens is taken, not by foreign enemies,
but by rebels, and afterwards it is retaken. Several
vessels are in this predicament. Even if the recapture
were from a foreign enemy, English and American
statutes treat it as a case of salvage, and not of prize.
But the claim now made involves nothing less than the
extension of the ancient rule of war to a new class. I
am against such extension. I would have no amplification
of such a rule.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>I am disposed to go still further, and to reconsider
the whole policy of prize-money in any case. Even if
not ready for this larger question, the Senate will not
hesitate to apply the limitation now proposed. Besides
the hardship of prize-money at the expense of our own
fellow-citizens, there is the uncivilized character of the
whole system, which should make us pause.</p>

<p>The bill under consideration was “to establish and equalize the
grades of line officers of the United States Navy.” By this bill the
rank of Admiral was established in the national navy. Mr. Hale moved
to reduce the pay of admirals from five thousand seven hundred and
eighteen to five thousand dollars.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">I hope the amendment will prevail. For years we
have been asked to make admirals. Congress has
refused,&mdash;partly, perhaps, from motives of economy,
and partly, also, from hesitation to create officers with
that rank and title.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, I am willing, considering the increase of our
navy and the exigency of the public service at this time,
to create officers with that rank and title. So doing, we
confer honor and consideration,&mdash;we bestow what officers,
military and naval, naturally covet. Wherever they
go, they will be addressed as Admiral; and, with naval
men, that is much. Sir, I believe it more than money.
But, while bestowing rank, I hesitate to increase emolument
largely, particularly at this moment of our history.
It costs nothing to confer rank; but it will be
most expensive to the Treasury, if we enter upon a new
scale of pay. Therefore I follow the Senator from New
Hampshire in his proposition to reduce the salary. Create
the admirals,&mdash;bestow this new title, this considerat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>ion,

<div class="medium">

<p>The Senate having under consideration a bill “relating to the Judiciary,”
in which provision was made for proceedings “in the courts
of the United States,” Mr. Sumner made another attempt to overthrow
the rule excluding colored witnesses by the following amendment:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And there shall be no exclusion of any witness on account of color.”</p>

</div>

<p>This was rejected,&mdash;Yeas 14, Nays 21.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At the next stage of the bill, Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;This bill relates to the national
judiciary. The Senate is making rules for
the courts of the United States, and now by its vote
sanctions the rule that a witness who happens to have
a color different from ours is incompetent to testify, he
cannot be heard in court. The practical effect of such
exclusion is, that any outrage by a white man on a colored
person, if no other white person is present, must
go unpunished; and the Senate of the United States
refuses to interfere against this cruelty. I must say,
Sir, that I lose my interest in the bill, when it is associated
with such wickedness,&mdash;for such I must call it.
If there is any outrage at this moment in the form of
law, and actually within our reach, it is what I now hold
up to the indignation of the country and of mankind.
It is hard to think that human beings can be placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
thus defenceless by Act of Congress,&mdash;that masters or
overseers, being white, may offer to colored persons any
offence, any brutality, and the testimony of the witnesses,
merely because they are colored, shall be excluded absolutely.
And yet, Sir, that is what the Senate to-day
declares.</p>

<p>The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. <span class="smcap">Hale</span>] has
voted to sustain this cruelty. Other Senators have voted
to sustain it. It is their privilege. Each Senator
votes, I know, according to his conscience; but, Sir, I
call attention to the vote, and remind you of what occurred
on another occasion. Formerly, when I moved
this proposition, it was opposed on the allegation that
it was not pertinent to the bill under consideration.
When I moved it, the other day, on what was known
as the Confiscation Bill, the other Senator from New
Hampshire [Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>] mildly suggested, that, at a
proper occasion, on a proper bill, he would be ready
to support it. I know that the motion must have the
approbation of that excellent Senator. He is too just
and too humane not to be in favor of it. And now, Sir,
the time has come. Here is a bill regulating evidence
in courts of the United States,&mdash;not in courts of the
States, but in courts of the United States. The whole
subject is directly before you. It is within your province
now to decide. Yours the jurisdiction and power.
And yet, Sir, you choose to continue the wrong. I shall
vote for the bill on its final passage, because in other
respects I think it ought to be a law; but I enter my
protest against the conclusion of the Senate. It is melancholy,
disastrous, discreditable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Hale vindicated the vote of the Senate, and insisted that the
proper object of attack was the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner replied:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>The Senator from New Hampshire severely criticizes
the Supreme Court, which he reminds us has decided
that the rights of citizenship, being rights that white
men are bound to respect, and all the rights which make
human life worth anything, are dead to colored persons;
and he then proceeds forthwith to sustain a principle
every way as bad. He condemns Chief-Justice Taney
for declaring that colored persons are not citizens, and
then, with marvellous logic, proceeds to say that he will
not interfere to overturn the rule by which the testimony
of colored persons is excluded from the national
courts. Sir, I do not know which is most open to
condemnation, the Supreme Court or the Senator. I
am against the decision of the Supreme Court. The
Senator knows it well. I am not one whit behind him
in condemnation of that judgment, which must forever
stand forth among the inhumanities of this generation.
But permit me to remind the Senator that the rule he
sustains is not less inhuman. There is not a word he
can launch against the Court that must not rebound
upon himself. To me it is unintelligible as painful
that the Senator should interfere to save any such
inhumanity. I use strong language, but it is only in
this way that I can fitly characterize the doctrines of
the Supreme Court and of the Senator. The Supreme
Court has erred infinitely and wretchedly, but the Senator
now errs in the same way.</p>

<p>The Senator is entirely mistaken, when he says that
the rule which I seek to overturn proceeds from the
Supreme Court. It is no such thing; and if I can
have his attention one moment, I can make him understand
it. The rule against the testimony of colored pe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>rsons
stands on the local law of the States, and not on
any decision of the Supreme Court of the United States.
The Court cannot interfere with it one way or the other.
Congress alone, when legislating for its own courts,
can interfere with it; and I entreat the Senate now,
as it is about to legislate for the national courts, to
interfere with it. The amendment of the Senator from
Connecticut, which I have in my hand, is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That <em>the laws of the several States</em>, except where the Constitution,
treaties, or statutes of the United States shall otherwise
require or provide, shall be regarded as <em>rules of decision
in all trials at Common Law</em> in the courts of the United
States, in cases where they apply.”</p>

</div>

<p>That is, the laws of the several States shall be rules
of decision in the United States courts. That is what
we declare. I simply propose to add, that those laws
shall not be rules of decision in the United States
courts, so far as they exclude witnesses on account of
color. The Senator from New Hampshire opposes this
just, humane, and irresistible proposition; and his argument
is, that, instead of reaching the result by legislation,
we must overturn the Supreme Court. Sir, permit
me to say, his argument is entirely inapplicable, his
whole philippic against the Supreme Court is out of
place. Whether I agree with him or not, it is plain
that this is not the time for it; and I must confess that
I like to see things in their proper place. The question
now is much more simple, more direct. Why enter
upon the ample, illimitable debate which the Senator
opens? Why review the Supreme Court and its relations
to the country, and whether it shall be overturned,
whether it shall be reformed, whether it shall be mod<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>ified?
All this has nothing to do with the question, and
the Senator, when he introduced it, simply diverted attention
from the business before us. I do not know
that he did it purposely. Indeed, I rather suspect the
ardor of his nature, which has led him into this strange
diversion with its irrelevant amplification.</p>

<p>But the Senator says that the cases in which colored
persons are interested arise in the State courts, and
not in the United States courts, and that therefore my
amendment is entirely inapplicable. The Senator is entirely
mistaken again. The United States courts have
jurisdiction of crimes without reference to color. They
also have civil jurisdiction in other cases which do not
depend upon citizenship. The Senator, as a lawyer,
knows this well; and yet, deliberately, by vote, and now
by speech, he upholds the barbarous rule of exclusion
on account of color. Sir, I do not know which was
worse, the vote or the speech, although the latter was
in harmony with the former. I was astonished at the
vote. I am now astonished at the speech, which, pardon
me, is as illogical in argument as bad in principle.
Most kindly, but most earnestly, do I dissent from it.
Sir, I do not wish to take up time, but the subject is
of transcendent importance. You will bear with my
frankness, if I add, that sanctioning this exclusion can
do no honor to Congress. I am sure it must be recorded
in judgment against us, and deservedly too. Civilization
will blush at the record. God save us!</p>

negro to this bill. I hope and trust that the Senate and the Congress of the
United States will be allowed to mature and perfect some few bills, in which
the interests and the business of the white man are involved, without having
this ever-present negro stuck upon them by the Senator from Massachusetts.
If he desires to bring up this matter of the negro in connection with the rules
of proceeding in the Federal courts, let him introduce a distinct bill, and
not make everything odoriferous of his friend.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Sumner then renewed his motion in the form of a proviso, and
afterwards the Senate adjourned. The bill was never taken up again.
But the same question was soon presented on another bill.</p>

<p>July 15th, the Senate had under consideration a bill concerning
the competency of witnesses in courts of the United States, which provided
that this should be regulated by “the laws of the State in which
the court shall be held.” Mr. Sumner offered his amendment again.
It was opposed by Mr. Foster, of Connecticut, who had reported the
pending bill. In the course of his remarks he said: “It is competent
for every State to fix its own rules for itself, and the independence of
each State of every other State requires that they should be protected
in that right of making their own laws.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner replied:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;It may be well, as the Senate is
called to enact a new national statute, to glance back at
an early landmark, and contemplate the principles declared
by our fathers. I hold in my hand the Declaration
of Independence, with these words at the beginning:
“We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men
are created equal,” &amp;c. Now, Sir, the Senator from Connecticut
[Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>], representing the Judiciary Committee,
proposes to establish as a rule of evidence in the
national courts that men are not equal.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Foster here interrupted to say that he proposed “no such rule of
evidence”; that he simply proposed “to allow the laws of the several
States of this Union to operate as rules to control the courts of the
United States sitting within those several States, as it regards the competency
of witnesses: that is all.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner resumed:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>I could not intentionally do the Senator injustice.
Nor do I find that I did him injustice; and he will
therefore pardon me, if I repeat what I said before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>,&mdash;that,
representing the Judiciary Committee, the Senator
comes forward, in defiance of the Declaration of Independence,
to ingraft into the legislation of the United
States the practical principle that all men are not equal.
The Senator rises and denies that he is doing any such
thing. He simply recognizes local laws in the States.
That is all,&mdash;nothing else. But pray, Sir, is not this
enough? Local laws which defy the Declaration of
Independence cannot be recognized without defying
the Declaration; nor can the Senator escape responsibility
merely by saying that he follows the local laws.
Does he not sanction injustice? The case is plain. He
asks us to legislate on the competency of witnesses.
He proposes to regulate this competency by Act of
Congress, where, among other things, we are to provide
that in the courts of the United States witnesses shall
be incompetent on account of color. The proposition is
not made openly, but in the covert words, that the local
laws of States shall in all cases prevail in the national
courts. The Senator cannot forget these local laws,
how instinct with barbarism they are, nor the shame
and scandal they bring upon our country and upon civilization
itself; and yet he would give them new sanction
and effect,&mdash;not in the courts of the States, within
the local jurisdiction, but in the courts of the United
States, under the Constitution of the United States,
within the national jurisdiction, where you and I, Sir,
are responsible for the barbarism. No matter in what
form it is put, no matter how subtly the attempt is concealed,
it is the adoption by Congress of an outrageous
rule.</p>

<p>Offer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span> any objection you please to the credibility of a
witness, show that he is not intelligent, that he is not
worthy of belief, that his character is bad, and make all
proper deductions from his testimony on this account,
but do not say that he is absolutely incompetent, that
he cannot be heard in court, that, no matter how intelligent,
truthful, or respectable, he cannot be admitted to
testify, if he happens to be of another color than ourselves.
Such exclusion is cruel to the witness, degrading
to courts administering it, and destructive of justice,
which seeks evidence from every quarter.</p>

<p>I listened closely to the ingenious argument of the
Senator, going along with him in what he claimed for
the States and for their courts. He said, each State is
entitled, within its own jurisdiction, to have its rules of
evidence. Granted. He thought it better to leave every
State its own rule on this question. Granted again, Sir,
so far as the courts of the States are concerned.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Foster.</span> Why allow them barbarism?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Because I have no right to interfere with
them.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Foster.</span> That answers the two questions.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> There is the mistake of the Senator.
He confounds our duties in the two different cases of
national courts, where we are responsible, and of State
courts, where we have no responsibility and no right to
interfere. In his remarks he said: “It is competent
for each State to make these rules for itself.” Granted
again,&mdash;within its own jurisdiction. But he would
allow each State its sovereign will on this question.
Sir, where I cannot constitutionally interfere to check
a barbarism, of course I do not interfere; sorrowfully I
allow the sovereign will to prevail. But when a barbarism
seeks shelter under the jurisdiction of Congress,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
when it falls under the direct responsibility of my vote,
I cannot be silent.</p>

<p>The Senator will pardon me, if I add, that he erred,
when he undertook to transfer the rules of the State
courts, without amendment or modification, to the National
courts. The State courts have their rules of evidence,&mdash;they
are beyond our control; but the United
States courts are within our control, and the time has
come to bring them at last within the pale of civilization.
Why, Sir, has the good cause advanced thus far?
to what end is it triumphant on this floor, if, in determining
rules of evidence in the national courts, we take
up and sanction this relic of barbarism?</p>

<p>If the rule is not justly within our reach, pray, Sir,
why are we asked to vote on a bill concerning the competency
of witnesses, and with a section expressly regulating
the whole subject? Sir, I should feel untrue
to myself, untrue to the principles I have at heart,
and to the people I have the honor to represent, if I
allowed a bill like this, with such a title, with such
an object, to pass without earnest endeavor to exclude
from it all support of the vileness which seeks shelter
under its words. Within a few days the Senator
has voted for a bill to punish the fraudulent
counterfeiting of postage stamps; but suppose the counterfeiter
does his work in the presence of colored persons
and nobody else, where, under the proposed rule,
will the Senator find the evidence required to carry the
law into effect? As long as Congress undertakes to
legislate criminally, as long as it has courts with a national
jurisdiction in the Slave States, it is due to itself,
and it is due to justice, that it should furnish the evidence
by which such legislation may be made effective,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
and justice be administered, without a constant act of
shame calculated to bring a blush upon the cheeks. I
speak plainly, as is my habit, and perhaps with feeling,
but I trust that I have said nothing that I ought not
to say.</p>

<p>This was reported from the Judiciary Committee, by Mr. Harris, of
New York, with certain amendments, one of which recognized “the
laws and <em>institutions</em>” in a State before the Rebellion. On the latter
amendment Mr. Sumner remarked:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;I cannot consent to the amendment.
Plainly it is going too far. A government
organized by Congress and appointed by the President
is to enforce laws and institutions, some of which are
abhorrent to civilization. Take, for instance, the Revised
Code of North Carolina, which I have before me.
Here is a provision which the Governor, under this Act,
must enforce. I say must enforce. The amendment
is, that there shall be “no interference with the laws
and institutions existing in such State at the time its
authorities assumed to array the same against the Government
of the United States.” Therefore they must
be enforced. And now, if you please, listen to one of
them.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Any free person, who shall teach, or attempt to teach,
an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>y slave to read or write, the use of figures excepted, or
shall give or sell to such slave any book or pamphlet, shall
be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction
thereof, if a white man or woman, shall be fined not less
than one hundred nor more than two hundred dollars, or
imprisoned, and if a free person of color, shall be fined,
imprisoned, or whipped, not exceeding thirty-nine nor less
than twenty lashes.”</p>

</div>

<p>That abomination, Sir, is set forth in the Revised Code
of North Carolina, chap. 34, sec. 82. But lest it should
fail by the employment of slaves as school-teachers, we
have the following prohibition.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It shall not be lawful for any slave to teach, or attempt
to teach, any other slave or free negro to read or write, the
use of figures excepted.”<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The punishment of slaves for this offence is whipping,
repeated for every act. But, Sir, here is another
specimen.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If any person shall wilfully bring into the State, with
an intent to circulate, or shall wilfully circulate or publish
within the State, or shall aid or abet the bringing into, or
the circulation or publication of within, the State, any
written or printed pamphlet or paper, whether written or
printed in or out of the State, the evident tendency whereof
is to cause slaves to become discontented with the bondage
in which they are held by their masters and the laws regulating
the same, and free negroes to be dissatisfied with
their social condition and the denial to them of political
privileges, and thereby to excite among the said slaves and
free negroes a disposition to make conspiracies, insurrections,
or resistance against the peace and quiet of the public,
such person so offending shall be deemed guilty of felony,
and on conviction thereof shall, for the first offence, be imprisoned
not less than one year, and be put in the pillory
and whipped, at the discretion of the court, and for the
second offence <em>shall suffer death</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Here is yet another.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If any free person of color shall preach or exhort in public,
or in any manner officiate as a preacher or teacher in
any prayer meeting, or other association for worship, where
slaves of different families are collected together, he shall be
deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and, on conviction, shall,
for each offence, receive not exceeding thirty-nine lashes on
his bare back.”<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

</div>

<p>And now one more.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If any person shall wilfully carry or convey any slave,
the property of another, without the consent of the owner
or the guardian of the owner, with the intent and for the
purpose of enabling such slave to escape out of this State,
from the service of his owner, or any one having an interest
in such slave, present or future, vested or contingent, legal
or equitable, or if any person shall wilfully conceal any slave,
the property of another, with such intent and purpose, the
person so offending shall suffer death.”<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

</div>

<p>I have read enough, Sir. These passages show you
the statutes to be enforced in the name of the National
Union, by its constituted authorities, in courts organized
by Congress. And behind all these is Slavery itself to
be enforced also.</p>

<p>Sir, such an exhibition is more than sufficient. You
cannot consent to any such thing. In organizing these
governments, all that we can do is to protect life and
property, and generally to provide the machinery of
administration. Further we cannot go, and protect institutions
in themselves an outrage to civilization.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>In the debate that ensued Mr. Sumner remarked:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>In this country there is but one “institution,” as all
the world knows, and the phrase “and institutions,”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>when carefully introduced, means only one institution,
which I need not name.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Trumbull united with Mr. Sumner in criticizing the bill.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I was for it in the Committee; but since I have seen the operation of
these laws in the Southern States, and the manner in which persons acting
in behalf of the United States undertake to execute them, I have changed
my opinion in regard to the propriety of such a clause as this, and I agree
with the Senator from Massachusetts. I cannot consent by my vote, and I
never will consent by my vote, to give sanction to a law that punishes a
man for teaching another to read the word of God.”</p>

</div>

<p>The bill was allowed to drop. But this debate had its influence in
showing how impossible it was to recognize “institutions” existing in
a State before the Rebellion. Slavery and the Black Code were not
to obtain license under any such terms. Here was a point in Reconstruction.</p>

<h2><a name="TAXES_ON_KNOWLEDGE" id="TAXES_ON_KNOWLEDGE"></a>TAXES ON KNOWLEDGE.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Remarks in the Senate, on the Duties upon Imported Books and
Rags, July 8, 1862.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;I ask a moment’s attention
to the tax on books, which is raised in this bill
from fifteen to twenty per cent. Assuming that this
is done to increase the revenue, I have to say, that, if
we place reliance on the evidence before us, it will not
have such effect.</p>

<p>The annual importation of books during the last four
years shows that a duty of ten per cent is more productive
than a higher rate. The increased importation is
more than compensation for the diminished rate; but
here it is with books as with other things.</p>

<p>If there were a tax on the manufacture of books in
our country, there might be reason for a corresponding
duty; but there is no such tax.</p>

<p>By the experience of the last tariff we are warned.
The increase of this duty was disastrous to the book-trade,
and I am assured that several booksellers who
have imported largely are withdrawing from this branch
of business, because the rate of fifteen per cent renders
it unprofitable. And yet you propose to raise the rate
to twenty per cent.</p>

<p>Nor is there any practical argument founded on protection.
There are no interests requiring protection
which will be promoted by an increased duty, as appears
in last year’s memorial of publishers and i<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>mporters,
praying a reduction to ten per cent, and also in
another and later memorial from New York importers,
praying for the same reduction, and setting forth that
their business seriously suffers from the existing rate.</p>

<p>And now I add, that this increased duty is a tax on
knowledge, and as such to be discountenanced and opposed.
But I rest my argument on the simple ground,
that it will not increase the revenue. If at this exacting
moment it would have any such consequence, much
as I should regret the necessity, I could not oppose it.
But it is easy to show that such will not be the consequence:
at least, the statistics point this way. The total
value of books imported in 1858, with a duty of eight
per cent, amounted to five hundred and thirty thousand
dollars: I do not give the odd figures. The total
value in 1859, likewise with a duty of eight per cent,
was seven hundred and seventy-seven thousand dollars;
and in 1860, with the same rate, it was seven hundred
and thirty-four thousand. In 1861, the total value,
with a duty of fifteen per cent, sank as low as three hundred
and forty-six thousand. These figures speak.</p>

<p>I do not err, when I infer from them that the higher
duty has been an injury to the revenue, and also
to the importer. Therefore it is open to a twofold objection.
With a duty of ten per cent the revenue would
gain, and the public with the importer would be benefited.</p>

<p>The case is stated in a few words. An increased
duty on books will do nothing for the revenue; but it
will interfere with a useful business, and at the same
time impose a tax on knowledge.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>
<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Sumner moved to reduce the tax from twenty to ten per cent,
but, at the suggestion of Mr. Fessenden, Chairman of the Finance Committee,
consented to fifteen per cent, which was adopted. The amendment
failed between the two Houses.</p>

<p>The bill as it came from the House had a proviso, “That all imported
cotton and linen rags for the manufacture of paper shall be free
of duty.” Mr. Sumner made an ineffectual effort to prevent this from
being struck out. In the course of his remarks, he said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>Here is another tax on knowledge. On the face it is
a tax on rags; but rags are imported to make paper; so
that a tax on rags is a tax on paper, and as such is a
tax on knowledge.</p>

<h2><a name="CONSTITUTIONAL_QUORUM_OF_THE_SENATE" id="CONSTITUTIONAL_QUORUM_OF_THE_SENATE"></a>CONSTITUTIONAL QUORUM OF THE SENATE.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Speech in the Senate, on a Resolution declaring the Constitutional
Quorum, July 12, 1862.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>According to long-continued usage, a quorum of the Senate was a
majority of the whole number of Senators, assuming each State represented
by two Senators. After the withdrawal of the Rebel Senators,
business was often embarrassed from the failure of what was supposed
to be the constitutional quorum. To remove this difficulty, Mr. Sherman,
April 11th, introduced the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That a majority of the Senators duly elected and entitled to
seats in this body is a constitutional quorum.”</p>

</div>

<p>July 12th, Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;What is a quorum depends
upon the Constitution; but we approach its consideration
with the knowledge that in England, the original
home of our institutions, and especially of Parliamentary
Law, the question, for a long period anterior to
the National Constitution, was fixed by usage. Indeed,
usage is authority for the larger part of the English
Constitution. But in this case of a quorum the usage
is liable to alteration. In his elaborate work on the
Law and Practice of Legislative Assemblies, the Parliamentary
Law on the subject is thus stated by Mr. Cushing:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In the British Parliament, according to the ancient and
invariable usage of the two Houses, as evidenced by their
rules, three is the number necessary to constitute a quorum
of the Lords, and forty a quorum of the Commons. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
numbers, respectively, although established by and dependent
upon usage merely, and within the power of each House to
abrogate or change at any time, have, nevertheless, the force
of standing orders; that is, they are equally binding upon
every succeeding Parliament until abrogated, and do not
require to be specially adopted in order to be in force.”<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It will be observed that the quorum of the Commons,
numbering six hundred and fifty-four persons, is only
forty, and this number appears to have been recognized
as long ago as 5th January, 1640. At an earlier day
more than sixty was required, and as late as March
18, 1801, an attempt was made in the Commons to
revive this ancient rule, but it failed. For a short
time in 1833 and 1834 the quorum for private business
was twenty.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>The quorum of the Lords, numbering four hundred
and sixty-five, is only three. A spectator at the law
sessions of the Upper House is struck by the appearance
of the Lord Chancellor on the woolsack, in wig
and gown, listening to arguments, with two lay lords,
like two lay figures, on the side benches, merely to constitute
a quorum so as to legalize the decision of the
Chancellor. The origin of this quorum, having the sanction
of unbroken usage, is lost in the night of Antiquity.
It is probably founded on the ancient maxim of
the Roman Law, <i>Tres faciunt collegium</i>,&mdash;“Three make
a <em>college</em>,”&mdash;the latter word being equivalent, in some
respects, to our word <em>corporation</em>.</p>

<p>Thus, according to Parliamentary Law, two things
appear: first, the quorum of each House is within the
control of the House; secondly, it is now, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>lways has
been, in each House, much smaller than a majority.</p>

<p>With us the quorum, in general terms, is fixed by the
Constitution. It is not left to usage, or the control of
each House; but it is reasonable to infer that any question
on the meaning of the Constitution, arising from
generality of language, may be interpreted in the light
of Parliamentary Law. Indeed, this is only according to
the rule under which all technical words in the Constitution
are interpreted. For instance, words known to
the Common Law or to the English Chancery are interpreted
according to the Common Law or the English
Chancery. Mr. Wirt, in his admirable argument on the
impeachment of Judge Peck, states the rule in these
words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Constitution secures the <em>trial by jury</em>. Where do
you get the meaning of a <em>trial by jury</em>? Certainly not from
the Civil or Canon Law, or the Law of Nations. It is peculiar
to the <em>Common Law</em>; and to the Common Law, therefore, the
Constitution itself refers you for a description and explanation
of this high privilege, <em>the trial by jury</em>, and the mode
of proceeding in those trials.… I insist, that, the moment
that <em>a Court of Common Law</em> or <em>a Court of Equity</em> is established
under the authority of the Constitution, its modes of
proceeding and its powers of self-protection arise with it, and
that the <em>very name</em> by which it is called into being authorizes
it to look at once to the English archetypes for its
government in these particulars.”<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

</div>

<p>According to this rule, so clearly enunciated, the words
“quorum” and “House,” which are derived from English
Parliamentary Law, may be explained by that
law; so that, in case of doubt, that law is for this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span> purpose
embodied in the Constitution. Now the Constitution
declares that <em>a majority of each House</em> shall constitute
a quorum to do business. The rule, it will be
observed, is the same for each House. But the question
arises, What is a majority of each House? or rather,
putting aside all question with regard to the House of
Representatives, which is perfectly free to determine for
itself, What is a majority of the Senate?</p>

<p>In fixing the quorum at a majority rather than any
smaller number, our Constitution followed the law of
business corporations, where a majority always prevails,
according to an old maxim of the Common Law,&mdash;<i>Ubi
major pars est, ibi est totum</i>,&mdash;“Where <em>the greater part</em>
is, there is the whole.” This rule is so reasonable, that it
has been vindicated by an eminent authority as founded
on the Law of Nature. Here are the words of the great
jurist Savigny:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The will of a corporation is not merely the concurring
will of all its members, but even that of the greater number.
Therefore the will of a majority of all its existing members
is to be regarded as being properly invested with the rights
of the corporation. This rule is founded on the Law of Nature,
inasmuch as, if unanimity were demanded, will and
action on the part of a corporation would be quite impossible.

<p>Thomas Jefferson, a very different person from the
German jurist, has also vindicated the rule.</p>

<p>“The <i>Lex majoris partis</i> is founded in Common Law as
well as common right. It is the natural law of every assembly
of men whose numbers are not fixed by any other
law.”<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>But the question still occurs, What is the major part
of the Senate? Is it the major part of the abstract or
theoretical Senate, or the major part of the real Senate?
In other words, is it the major part of the Senate contemplated
by the Constitution, with two Senators from
each State, or the major part of the actual Senate, counting
only those entitled to vote? At the present moment
there is a wide difference between the two cases.</p>

<p>Several clauses of the Constitution are applicable to
this question. I group them together.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Senate of the United States shall be composed of
two Senators from each State, chosen by the Legislature
thereof for six years.”</p>

<p>“<em>A majority of each House</em> shall constitute a quorum to
do business.”</p>

<p>“The Congress, whenever <em>two thirds of both Houses</em> shall
deem it necessary, shall propose amendments to this Constitution.”</p>

<p>“A quorum for the purpose [the election of Vice-President]
shall consist of two thirds of <em>the whole number of Senators</em>,
and a majority of the whole number shall be necessary to a
choice.”</p>

</div>

<p>Probably “the whole number of Senators” is equivalent
to the term “House.” But what is the “House”?</p>

<p>The Senate <i>de jure</i> consists of two Senators from each
State.</p>

<p>The Senate <i>de facto</i> may consist of Senators actually
elected and qualified, or of Senators actually elected.</p>

<p>Whether the “House” shall be the Senate <i>de jure</i> or
the Senate <i>de facto</i> is now within our discretion. The
question has been raised, and the way is open to adopt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
either interpretation, according to the meaning of the
Constitution as seen in the light of Parliamentary Law,
and, I add also, of convenience.</p>

<p>According to Parliamentary Law, the whole question
is in our hands.</p>

<p>According to convenience, the quorum should be
founded on the actual Senate, being the Senators actually
elected and qualified.</p>

<p>If ever the argument of convenience was strong,
peculiarly strong, it is now, when a wicked rebellion
has undertaken to withdraw the Senators of eleven
States, thus reducing our numbers. It is not necessary
to assert that these States should be no longer counted
among our stars. It is enough, if we declare that their
vacant chairs shall no longer be counted in our quorum.
As the language of the Constitution is drawn into debate,
I cannot doubt, that, according to Parliamentary
Law, the present question is within the control of the
Senate, to be determined by the teachings of reason
and convenience, so as to assure the public welfare.
Any other interpretation must leave the Senate to all
the hazards of disorganization by treason, or, it may
be, by indifference. If the Senate declines to exercise
this power, it will abandon an essential principle of self-defence.</p>

<p>An extreme case might be put, where, through defection,
the actual Senators are reduced to a mere handful.
But the rule is not to be tried by any such extreme case,
which can occur only when the Government is broken
up.</p>

<p>I rest confidently on the double conclusion: first,
that the words of the Constitution with regard to the
quorum of the Senate, so far as doubtful, are to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
interpreted by Parliamentary Law; and, secondly, that,
by Parliamentary Law, these words are within the
control of the Senate, to be interpreted according to
its own ample discretion under the exigency of the
occasion.</p>

of the two Houses, July 12, 1862.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>July 12th, the question being on the final adjournment for the
Session, Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;I do not think, in the present
state of the country, the Senate ought to adjourn,
and for one I enter my protest against it, and I ask for
the yeas and nays that I may make it of record.</p>

<p>It is essential to proper legislation not only that the
Senate should vote, but that it should consider measures
on which it votes; and the consideration must be
in proportion to their importance. Allusion is made
to one measure on which the Senate has not voted,&mdash;that
in charge of my friend the Senator from Ohio
[Mr. <span class="smcap">Wade</span>], the admission of West Virginia as a new
State. Perhaps no question of greater importance has
ever been presented. It concerns the whole question
of Slavery; it concerns the pretension of State Rights;
it concerns also the results of this war. Look at it,
therefore, in any aspect you please, it is a great question.
And yet the idea of Senators anxious to adjourn
is, that it is to be hurried forward without any proper
discussion.</p>

<p>There is an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>other question, not less important. It is
the bill of the Senator from New York [Mr. <span class="smcap">Harris</span>],
constituting Provisional Governments for the Rebel
States,&mdash;a subject of transcendent importance, and I
submit, also, of practical interest at this very moment;
for it involves precisely this inquiry, Whether you are
to allow a system of military governments or Congressional
governments. It is a question between the
military and the civil power.</p>

<p>Then we have the Army Bill, which my colleague has
in charge. Few matters of greater importance have
ever been laid before the Senate. It involves nothing
less than the organization in our country of a system of
conscription, so well known on the Continent of Europe,
but thus far happily unknown to us; and yet, Sir, this
great question, also, is to be hurried forward without
any adequate discussion.</p>

<p>Then we have Executive business, to which I can
only allude in a general way, but of vast moment,
which cannot be adequately considered without days,
and I might say weeks.</p>

<p>Then we have also the whole Calendar, to which the
Senator from Illinois has referred, that ought to occupy
us for weeks.</p>

<p>Here are at least five important matters,&mdash;West Virginia,
the Provisional Governments, the Army Bill, Executive
business, and the whole Calendar,&mdash;all open
to consideration; and yet, Sir, Senators propose to go
home,&mdash;Senators are weary,&mdash;Senators would like to
find a retreat, away from these legislative cares. I can
enter into that feeling. Sir, I should be glad to be at
home. I suppose the gallant soldiers on the James
River, on the Chickahominy, would also be glad to be
at home. They are not excused, they have not a furlough,&mdash;and
yet we Senators talk of our furlough.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p>Now it is known that formerly, when Congress was
paid by the day, it never thought of adjourning at this
time. One of the most important bills on your statute
book bears date the 18th day of September, 1850;<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> and
for some years immediately thereafter Congress did
not adjourn until late in August. I think I have
sat myself close upon September; but when I mentioned
this fact the other day, the Senator from Ohio
reminded me that then Congress was paid by the day,
whereas now it is paid by the year. Has it come to
this, that Congress could sit here content when paid by
the day, and now that it is paid by the year it leaves
its important business to be neglected entirely, or to
be hurried forward without that discussion which it
ought to receive?</p>

<p>Sir, I hope the Senate will not consent to fix any
day of adjournment. I hope it will sit here, proceeding
regularly with the business now on its Calendar, and
meeting any contingencies which in the present state of
the country may arise. A duty is cast upon Congress
which ought not to be slighted. It is to see that the
Republic receives no detriment. Solemnly now this
duty addresses itself to all of us. Let us not neglect
it. For the sake of the public business, and for the
sake of those responsibilities which from their very
uncertainty at this crisis are so vast, I ask the Senate
to continue here.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The resolution, which was originally for adjournment on Monday,
July 14th, was amended by substituting Wednesday, July 16th, and
then, as amended, adopted,&mdash;Yeas 29, Nays 10.</p>

<p>July 14th, President Lincoln communicated to Congress the draught
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>of a bill to compensate any State which might abolish Slavery within
its limits, the passage of which as presented he earnestly recommended.
On motion of Mr. Sumner, the Message with the accompanying draught
was referred to the Committee on Finance. Immediately thereafter he
offered the following resolution.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That, in order that the two Houses of Congress may have time
for the proper consideration of the Message of the President and the accompanying
bill for Emancipation in the States, and for the transaction of
other public business, the resolution fixing Wednesday, the 16th of July, for
adjournment, is hereby rescinded.”</p>

<p>The consideration of the resolution was objected to.</p>

<p class="right medium"><span class="smcap">Washington</span>, July 14, 1862.</p>

<p class="dropcap">DEAR SIR,&mdash;I welcome and honor your patriotic
efforts to arouse the country to a generous, determined,
irresistible unity in support of the National
Government; but the Senate is still in session, and my
post of duty is here. A Senator cannot leave his post,
more than a soldier.</p>

<p>But, absent or present, the cause in which the people
are to assemble has my God-speed, earnest, devoted, affectionate,
and from the heart. What I can do let me do.
There is no work I will not undertake, there is nothing
I will not renounce, if so I may serve my country.</p>

<p>There must be unity of hands, and of hearts too, that
the Republic may be elevated to the sublime idea of a
true commonwealth, which we are told “ought to be but
as one huge Christian personage, one mighty growth and
stature of an honest man, as big and compact in virtue
as in body.”<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> Oh, Sir, if my feeble voice could reach
my fellow-countrymen, in workshops, streets, fields, and
wherever they meet together, if for one moment I could
take to my lips that silver trumpet with tones to sound
and reverberate throughout the land, I would summon
all, forgetting prejudice and turning away from error, to
help unite, quicken, and invigorate our common country&mdash;most
beloved now that it is most imperilled&mdash;to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
compactness and bigness of virtue in just proportion to
its extended dominion, so that it should be as one huge
Christian personage, one mighty growth and stature of
an honest man, instinct with all the concentration of
unity. Thus inspired, the gates of Hell cannot prevail
against us.</p>

<p>To this end the cries of faction must be silenced, and
the wickedness of sedition, whether in print or public
speech, must be suppressed. These are the Northern
allies of the Rebellion. An aroused and indignant people,
with iron heel, must tread them out forever, as men
tread out the serpent so that it can neither hiss nor
sting.</p>

<p>With such concord God will be pleased, and He will
fight for us. He will give quickness to our armies, so
that the hosts of the Rebellion will be broken and
scattered as by the thunderbolt; and He will give to
our beneficent government that blessed inspiration, better
than newly raised levies, by which the Rebellion
shall be struck in its single vulnerable part, by which
that colossal abomination, its original mainspring and
present motive power, shall be overthrown, while the
cause of the Union is linked with that divine justice
whose weapons are of celestial temper.</p>

<p>God bless our country! and God bless all who now
serve it with singleness of heart!</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>While the bill providing for Confiscation and Liberation was in the
hands of the President, and before its signature, it was understood that
he objected to it on certain grounds, one of which was that under it
real estate was forfeited beyond life. In point of fact, the President
had already drawn up a Message stating his objections to its becoming
a law.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> In anticipation of these objections, a joint resolution was
adopted, containing the provision, “Nor shall any punishment or proceedings
under said Act be so construed as to work a forfeiture of the
real estate of the offender beyond his natural life.”<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Sumner did not sympathize with the objections, but, in his anxiety
to secure the approval of the Act as a step to Emancipation, he did
not hesitate to support the joint resolution.</p>

<p>July 16th, he said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;Our country is in peril. This
is much to say, but it must be said, and we must
all govern ourselves accordingly. More than ever before,
the time has come for an earnest, absolute, controlling
patriotism. This is the lesson of the day. In presence
of such peril, and under the weight of such duties, there
is no pride of opinion which I would not freely sacrifice,
nor can I stand on any order of proceeding. I ask no
questions, and I make no terms. Show me how an
important measure can be secured, which I think vita<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>l
to the country, and I shall spare no effort to secure it.</p>

<p>Rules are for protection, for defence, and to facilitate
business. If in any way they become an impediment,
they cease to perform their natural office, and I can
easily abandon them, especially when my country may
suffer. Therefore, Sir, I am only slightly impressed by
the argument that our information with regard to the
President is informal. It is enough that a measure
we all have at heart as essential to national life may
fail to receive his constitutional approval, unless modified
in advance by supplementary statute. Anxious for
this measure, I think how it may be secured, rather than
how the opinions of the President have become known
to us.</p>

<p>Of course, Sir, I cannot share the doubts attributed to
the President. To me they seem groundless and fallacious.
Waiving all question of their accuracy as an
interpretation of the Constitution, even in criminal proceedings,
I cannot forbear saying that they proceed on
the mistaken idea of a procedure by <em>indictment</em> and not
by <em>war</em>, subjecting the country to all the constraint of a
criminal trial when the exigency requires the ample latitude
of war. If soldiers are sent forth to battle, if fields
are occupied as camps, and houses are occupied as hospitals,
without permission of the owners, it is under the
War Powers of Congress, or, in other words, the belligerent
rights of this Government. And it is by virtue of
these same belligerent rights that the property of an enemy
is taken. Now, if he be an enemy, is there in the
Constitution any check upon these rights? Whether
you choose to take property for life or beyond life, the
Constitution is indifferent; for all constitutional limitations
are entirely inapplicable to belligerent rights.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
There are express words ordaining that you must not
“abridge the freedom of speech or of the press,” or “infringe
the right of the people to keep and bear arms”;
nor can you take “life, liberty, or property, without due
process of law.” And yet, wherever your armies move,
and elsewhere too, you do all these very things in the
exercise of acknowledged belligerent rights. As plainly,
the right of confiscation, whether for life or beyond life,
is also yours.</p>

<p>Unhappily, Sir, our country is engaged in war,&mdash;terrible,
relentless, unquestionable war,&mdash;and if we would
not discard success, it must be prosecuted as war, in the
full exercise of belligerent rights. If we were dealing
with sporadic cases of treason, with simple sedition, or
with a mere outbreak, our process would be limited by
the Constitution; but with an enemy before us, lashed
into fury and led on by “Até hot from Hell,” where is
the limit to the powers to be employed? I remember
that Burke, in his great effort on Conciliation with
America, says: “It looks to me to be narrow and pedantic
to apply the ordinary ideas of criminal justice
to this great public contest; I do not know the method
of drawing up an indictment against an whole people.”<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>
But when, on account of a provision in the Constitution
obviously intended only for the protection of <em>the citizen</em>,
you refuse to take the property of <em>an enemy in open war</em>,
then do you substitute the safeguards of criminal justice
for war, thus voluntarily weakening your armies and
diminishing your power. I am tempted to say, that, in
devotion to the form of the Constitution, you sacrifice
its substance. I might say, that, in misapplying the
text of the Constitution, you sacrifice the Constitutio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>n
itself.</p>

<p>Pardon me for seeming, even briefly, to argue this
question. I do it only because I would not have my
vote misunderstood. I shall support the proposition,
not because I concur with it, but because its adoption
will help secure the approval of the bill that has so
much occupied the attention of Congress and the hopes
of the country.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I have never, from the beginning, disguised
my conviction that the most important part of
the bill concerns Emancipation. To save this great part,
to secure this transcendent ally, to establish this assurance
of victory, and to obtain for my country this lofty
crown of prosperity and glory, I willingly abandon all
the rest. The navigator is called sometimes to save his
ship by casting part of the cargo into the sea.</p>

<p>But whatever the difference between the President
and Congress, there are two points on which there is no
difference. Blacks are to be employed, and slaves are to
be freed. In this legislative proclamation the President
and Congress will unite. Together they will deliver it
to the country and to the world.</p>

<p>It is an occasion of just congratulation, that the long
debates of the session have at last ripened into a measure
which I do not hesitate to declare more important
than any victory achieved by our arms. Thank God,
the new levies will be under an inspiration which cannot
fail. It is the idea of Freedom, which, in spite of
all discomfiture, past or present, must give new force to
the embattled armies of the Republic, making their conflicts
her own.</p>

<p>Sir, fro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>m this day forward the war will be waged with
new hopes and new promises. A new power is enlisted,
incalculable in influence, strengthening our armies, weakening
the enemy, awakening the sympathies of mankind,
and securing the favor of a benevolent God. The
infamous Order No. 3, which has been such a scandal
to the Republic, is rescinded. The slave everywhere can
hope. Beginning to do justice, we shall at last deserve
success.</p>

Mr. Claflin, Chairman of the State Committee, read the following letter
from Mr. Sumner, which, according to the report, was received with
great applause.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right medium"><span class="smcap">Boston</span>, September 9, 1862.</p>

<p class="dropcap">MY DEAR SIR,&mdash;As a servant of the State, I have
always recognized the right of my constituents in
State Convention to expect from me such counsels on
public affairs as I could offer, and I have accepted with
gratitude the invitations with which they have honored
me. If now, in these dark days, when danger thickens,
I do not take advantage of the opportunity you present,
believe me, it is not from indifference, nor is it because
our duties at this moment are uncertain.</p>

<p>Eagerly do gallant soldiers (God bless them!) rush to
the field of death for the sake of their country. Eagerly
do good citizens at home (God bless them!) contribute
of their abundance, or it may be of their poverty, to
smooth the lot of our gallant soldiers. But there is
another duty, hardly less commanding. It is union,
without distinction of party, to uphold the Governme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>nt,
and also to uphold those who uphold the Government.
Therefore do I recognize the just liberality of the call
for our Convention, which is addressed not only to
Republicans, but also to “all who support the present
National and State Governments and are in favor of the
use of all means necessary for the effectual suppression
of the Rebellion.” Under such a call there is no patriot
citizen of the Commonwealth who may not claim a
place.</p>

<p>Is there a patriot citizen who hesitates to support
the National Government, beleaguered by a rebel enemy?</p>

<p>Is there a patriot citizen who hesitates to support the
State Government, now, under the inspiring activity and
genius of John A. Andrew, so efficiently sustaining the
National Government?</p>

<p>And is there a patriot citizen who is not for the use
of all means necessary for the effectual suppression of
the Rebellion?</p>

<p>Were I able to be at the Convention, according to
the invitation with which you honor me, gladly would I
appeal to all such citizens. This country must be saved;
and among the omens of victory I hail confidently that
unanimity of sentiment and trust with which all loyal
citizens now look to the National Government, determined
that nothing of energy or contribution or sacrifice
shall be wanting, by which its supremacy may be
reëstablished. Another omen is yet needed. It is that
the people, forgetting the past, shall ascend to that plane
of justice and truth where is the light of candor, and all
shall frown indignantly upon the rancors and animosities
of party, which even now are so disturbing in their
influence, shall silence the senseless prejudices of per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>sonal
hate, and stifle the falsehoods of calumny, so that
here among ourselves there may be unity and concord,
giving irresistible strength to our patriotic labors.</p>

<p>Beyond this appeal from heart to heart, I should rejoice
to show clearly <em>how to hamstring this Rebellion
and to conquer a peace</em>, all of which I am sure can be
done. To this <em>single practical purpose</em> all theories, prepossessions,
and aims must yield. So absorbing at the
present moment is this question, that nothing is practical
which does not directly tend to its final settlement.
All else is blood-stained vanity. And the citizen soldiers
you send forth to battle may justly complain, if
you neglect any means by which they may be strengthened.
Good Democrats, who have enjoyed the confidence
of their party and also public trust,&mdash;Daniel S. Dickinson,
of New York, and Robert Dale Owen, of Indiana,&mdash;bear
their generous testimony. So also does Parson
Brownlow, of Tennessee, in a letter which I have just
read, where he says that the negroes “must be urged
in every possible way to crush out this infernal Rebellion.”
Butler bore his testimony, when, by virtue of
an outstanding order of the Rebel Governor of Louisiana,
he organized a regiment of colored persons in the
national service. Banks also symbolized the idea, when,
overtaking the little slave-girl on her way to Freedom,
he lifted her upon the national cannon. In this act&mdash;the
brightest, most touching, and most suggestive of the
whole war, which Art will hereafter rejoice to commemorate&mdash;our
Massachusetts general gave a lesson to his
country. Who can doubt that the country will yet be
saved?</p>

<p>The anxiety which prevailed so extensively was restored by the
Proclamation of Emancipation, at last put forth by the President, September
22, 1862. Besides enjoining obedience to the Acts of Congress
already passed against Slavery, it declared:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That, on the first day of January in the year of our Lord one thousand
eight hundred and sixty-three, all persons held as slaves within any State
or designated part of a State, the people whereof shall then be in rebellion
against the United States, shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free;
and the Executive Government of the United States, including the military
and naval authority thereof, will recognize and maintain the freedom of such
persons, and will do no act or acts to repress such persons, or any of them,
in any efforts they may make for their actual freedom.”<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The work was completed by the final proclamation of January 1,
1863.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>There was an echo to these proclamations throughout the country,
and also from the Rebel States. The <i>Richmond Whig</i> said of the first:
“It is a dash of the pen to destroy four millions of our property, and
is as much as a bid for the slaves to rise in insurrection, with the assurance
of aid from the whole military and naval power of the United
States.” In another article, it spoke of “the fiends of the new programme.”
These feelings, after debate in the Rebel Congress, found
vent in the following terms.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That, in the judgment of Congress, the proclamations of the President
of the United States, dated respectively September twenty-second, eighteen
hundred and sixty-two, and January first, eighteen hundred and sixty-three,
and the other measures of the Government of the United States, and of its
authorities, commanders, and forces, designed or tending to emancipate
slaves in the Confederate States, or to abduct such slaves, or to incite them
to insurrection, or to employ negroes in war against the Confederate States,
or to overthrow the institution of African Slavery and bring on a servile war
in these States, would, if successful, produce atrocious consequences, and
they are inconsistent with the spirit of those usages which in modern warfare
prevail among civilized nations; they may, therefore, be properly and
lawfully repressed by retaliation.”<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>The earlier proclamation caused a thrill in Massachusetts. Earnest
people, who had longed for it, were rejoiced and comforted. At the invitation
of his fellow-citizens, Mr. Sumner consented to address them
at Faneuil Hall, in response to the proclamation.</p>

<p>The proceedings at this crowded meeting, which was held at noon,
are copied from the newspapers of the day.</p>

Gifford.</p>

<p>On taking the chair, Mr. Claflin was received with great applause.
He spoke as follows.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Ladies and Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;None of you can be more disappointed at
the present time than myself, that I am called upon to occupy this position.</p>

<p>“At the last moment we were informed that his Excellency the Governor<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>
was compelled by the duties of his position, and his desire ever to
do for the interests of those brave men who have gone forth for our defence,
to leave the State, and to leave us to-day in your hands. [<i>Applause.</i>]</p>

<p>“Under these circumstances, and at the last moment, by the desire of
the Committee of Arrangements, I consented to occupy this position; but
you will, of course, excuse me from making any remarks on this occasion.
My heart is in the cause. This is a great era, and this is the time when
every man should come up to the work and fight for this nation, doing
everything which he can, whether by his purse or his sword, to sustain the
Government. [<i>Cheers.</i>]</p>

<p>“Thanking you for the honor you have conferred upon me, I now await
any motion which may be made.”</p>

</div>

<p>Resolutions sustaining Emancipation were then read by Charles W.
Slack, and, amidst cries of “Good!” and great applause, were adopted.</p>

<p>The President then said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I now introduce to you Massachusetts’&mdash;ay, Boston’s&mdash;honored son.
I need not praise him, I need not eulogize him; but I will simply say, it is
<span class="smcap">Charles Sumner</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>The enthusiasm that followed Senator Sumner’s stepping on the platform
was not surpassed by anything that has been seen in the Hall
since Senator Webster took the same place on <em>his</em> return from Washington
years ago. The air below was dark with waving hats, and along
the galleries white with fluttering kerchiefs. When the applause subsided,
a colored man cried out, “God bless Charles Sumner!” in an
earnest, trembling, “tearful” voice, and the applause was renewed.</p>

<p>The meeting is described as “of much enthusiasm on the part of the
overflowing audience that gathered and tried to gather within the ancient
walls.”</p>

<p>A few sentences from the London <i>Morning Star</i> will show how this
effort was recognized at a distance.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Massachusetts Senator has lately had a meeting with his constituents.
Fragments and summaries of his speech at Faneuil Hall have found
their way into most English newspapers. Let the sympathizers with the South
produce, if they can, from their side of Mason and Dixon’s line, any utterance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>to compare with it in all the qualities that should commend human
speech to human audience.…</p>

<p>“This representative of a powerful community addresses to his fellow-citizens
considerations upon the conduct of a war in which they and he are
more deeply interested than any English constituency has been in any war
which England has waged since the days of Cromwell. It is such a speech
as Hampden might have spoken in Buckinghamshire, or Pym in the Guildhall.
It treats both of principles and policy,&mdash;of the means of success, and
of the ends which can alone sanctify the struggle or glorify success. It
breathes throughout the spirit of justice and of freedom.…</p>

<p>“Throughout his public life, Mr. Sumner has held the same doctrines, expressed
the same spirit.… He is the leader of a party, as well as the representative
of the first New England State, and Chairman of the Foreign
Affairs Committee of Congress. Too advanced a thinker and too pure a
politician for office in a Cabinet undecided on the Slavery Question, he has
pioneered its way and shaped its conclusions. Is he not a man whose name
should check the blustering apologists of Slavery and Secession?… The
Rebellion is just such a blow at the Union as Preston Brooks struck at
Charles Sumner; and yet there are English hands and voices to applaud the
deed, as worthy heroes of patriotism and civilization.”</p>

</div>

<p>In urging Emancipation, Mr. Sumner always felt, that, besides sustaining
the cause of justice, he was helping our country with foreign
nations.</p>

<h3>SPEECH.</h3>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Fellow-Citizens of Massachusetts</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="dropcap">Meetings of the people in ancient Athens were
opened with these words: “May the gods doom
to perdition that man, and all his race, who, on this occasion,
shall speak, act, or contrive anything against the
Commonwealth!” With such an imprecation all were
summoned to the duties of the citizen. But duties become
urgent in proportion to perils. If ever there were
occasion for these solemn words, it is now, when the
country is in danger, when the national capital itself is
menaced, when all along the loyal border, from the Atlantic
Ocean to the Indian Territories west of the Mississippi,
barbarian hordes, under some Alaric of Slavery,
are marshalling forces, and death is knocking at the
doors of so many happy homes. If ever there was occasion
when country might claim the best and most self-forgetful
effort of all, it is now. Each in his way must
act. Each must do what he can: the youthful and
strong by giving themselves to the service; the weak,
if in no other way, by scraping lint. Such is the call
of patriotism. The country must be saved.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Among omens which I hail with gladness is the
union now happily prevailing among good men in support
of the Government, whether State or National,&mdash;forgetting
that they were Democrats, forgetting that
they were Whigs, and disregarding old party names, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
remember only the duties of the citizen. Another sign,
not less cheering, is the generous devotion which all
among us of foreign birth offer to their adopted country.
Germans fight as for fatherland, and Irishmen fight
as for loved Erin; nor can our cause be less dear to the
latter, now that the spirit of Grattan and O’Connell has
entered into it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Surely this is no time for the strife of party. Its
jealousies and antipathies are now more than ever irrational.
Its clamors of opposition are now more than
ever unpatriotic. Unhappily, there are some to whom
its bitter, unforgiving temper has become so controlling,
that, even at this moment, they would rather enlist to
put down a political opponent than to put down the
rebel enemy of their country,&mdash;they would rather hang
Henry Wilson or John A. Andrew than hang Jefferson
Davis or Robert Toombs. Such persons, with all
their sweltered venom, are found here in Massachusetts.
Assuming the badge of “No Party,” they are ready
for any party, new or old, by which their prejudices
may be gratified,&mdash;thus verifying the pungent words
of Colonel Benton: “Wherever you will show me a
man with the words ‘No Party’ in his mouth, I will
show you a man that figures at the head or dangles at
the tail of the most inveterate party that ever existed.”
Of course, such persons are not expected to take part
in a meeting like the present, which seeks to unite
rather than divide, while it rallies all to the support
of the President, and to that policy of Freedom he has
proclaimed.</p>

<p>Thank God t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>hat I live to enjoy this day! Thank
God that my eyes have not closed without seeing this
great salvation! The skies are brighter and the air is
purer now that Slavery is handed over to judgment.</p>

<p>By the proclamation of the President, all persons held
as slaves January 1, 1863, within any State or designated
part of a State, the people whereof shall then be
in rebellion against the United States, shall be then,
thenceforward, and forever free; and the Executive
Government of the United States, including the military
and naval authority thereof, will recognize and
maintain the freedom of such persons, and will do no
act or acts to repress such persons, or any of them, in
any efforts they may make for their actual freedom.
Beyond these most effective words, which do not go
into operation before the new year, are other words of
immediate operation, constituting a present edict of
Emancipation. The President recites the recent Acts
of Congress applicable to this question, and calls upon
all persons in the military and naval service to observe,
obey, and enforce them. But these Acts provide that all
slaves of Rebels, taking refuge within the lines of our
army, all slaves captured from Rebels or deserted by
them, and all slaves found within any place occupied
by Rebel forces and afterwards occupied by forces of the
United States, shall be forever free of servitude, and not
again held as slaves; and these Acts further provide,
that no person in the military or naval service shall,
under any pretence whatever, assume to decide on the
validity of any claim to a slave, or surrender any such
person to his claimant, on pain of being dismissed from
the service: so that by these Acts, now proclaimed by
the President, Freedom is practically secured to all who
find shelter within our lines, and the glorious flag of the
Union, wherever it floats, becomes the flag of Freedom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thank God for what is already done, and let us all
take heart as we go forward to uphold this great edict!
For myself, I accept the Proclamation without note or
comment. It is enough for me, that, in the exercise of
the War Power, it strikes at the origin and mainspring
of this Rebellion; for I have never concealed the conviction
that it matters little where we strike Slavery,
provided only that we strike sincerely and in earnest.
So is it all connected, that the whole must suffer with
every part, and the words of the poet will be verified,
that,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent9">“whatever link you strike,</div>
<div class="verse">Tenth or ten thousandth, breaks the chain alike.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>On this most interesting occasion, so proper for gratitude,
it is difficult to see anything but the cause; and
yet, appearing before you on the invitation of a Committee
of the Commonwealth, I must not forget that I
owe this privilege to my public character as Senator
of Massachusetts. In this character I have often been
invited before; but now the invitation has more than
accustomed significance; for, at the close of a long period
of public service, it brings me face to face with
my constituents. In a different condition of the country,
I could not decline the opportunity of reviewing
the relations between us,&mdash;of showing, at least, how
you took me from private station, all untried, and
gave me one of your highest trusts, and how this
trust was enhanced by the generosity with which you
sustained me against obloquy and vindictive assault,
especially by your unparalleled indulgence to me
throughout a protracted disability,&mdash;and perhaps, might
I be so bold, of presenting for your considerati<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>on some
sketch of what I have attempted, conscious, that, if not
always successful, I have been at all times faithful to
cherished convictions, and faithful also to your interests,
sparing nothing of time or effort, and making up
by industry for any lack of ability, so that, during a service
of more than eleven years, I have never once visited
home while Congress was in session, or been absent
for a single day, unless when suffering from that disability
to which I have referred, and during the session
which has just closed, filled with most laborious duties
from beginning to end, I was not out of my seat a single
hour. But this is no time for such a review. I have
no heart for it, while my country is in danger. And yet
I shall not lose the occasion to challenge the scrutiny
of all, even here in this commercial metropolis, where
the interests of business are sometimes placed above all
other interests. Frankly and fearlessly I make my appeal.
In all simplicity, I ask you to consider what I
have done as your servant, whether in the Senate or out
of the Senate, in matters of legislation or of business.
If there is any one disposed to criticize or complain,
let him be heard. Let the whole record be opened, and
let any of the numerous visitors who have sought me
on business testify. I know too well the strength of
my case to shrink from any inquiry, even though stimulated
by the animosity of political warfare.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>But there are two accusations, often repeated, to which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>I reply on the spot; and I do so with less hesitation,
because the topics are germane to this debate. The first
is, that from my place in the Senate I early proclaimed
Slavery to be Barbarism. Never shall the cause of
Freedom go by default, if I can help it; and I rejoice,
that, on that occasion, in presence of the slaveholding
conspirators vaunting the ennobling character of Slavery,
I used no soft words. It is true, that, in direct
reply to most offensive assumptions, I proclaimed Slavery
barbarous in origin, barbarous in law, barbarous in
all its pretensions, barbarous in the instruments it employs,
barbarous in consequences, barbarous in spirit,
barbarous wherever it shows itself,&mdash;while it breeds
barbarians, and develops everywhere, alike in the individual
and the society to which he belongs, the essential
elements of barbarism. It is true, that, on the same occasion,
I portrayed Slavery as founded in violence and
sustained only by violence, and declared that such a
wrong must, by sure law of compensation, blast the
master as well as the slave, blast the land on which
they live, blast the community of which they are part,
blast the government which does not forbid the outrage,
and the longer it exists, and the more completely it prevails,
must its blasting influence penetrate the whole
social system. Was I not right? Since then the testimony
is overwhelming. A committee of the Senate
has made a report, extensively circulated, on the barbarities
of this Rebellion. You know the whole story to
which each day testifies. It is in some single incident
that you see the low-water mark of social life; and I
know nothing in which the barbarism of Slavery is
more completely exhibited than in the fate of our brave
soldiers, dug up from honorable graves, where at last
they had found rest, that their bones might be carved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
into keepsakes and their skulls into drinking-cups to
gratify the malignant hate of Slave-Masters.</p>

<p>The other accusation is similar in character. It is
said that I have too often introduced the Slavery Question.
At this moment, seeing what Slavery has done, I
doubt if you will not rather say that I have introduced it
too seldom. If, on this account, I neglected any single
interest of my constituents, if I was less strenuous whenever
foreign relations or manufactures or commerce or
finances were involved, if I failed to take my part in
all that concerns the people of Massachusetts and in all
embraced within the manifold duties of a Senator, then,
indeed, I might be open to condemnation. But you will
not regret that your representative, faithful in all other
things, was ever constant and earnest against Slavery,
and that he announced from the beginning the magnitude
of the question, and our duties with regard to it.
Say what you will, the slave is the humblest and the
grandest figure of our times. What humility! what grandeur!
both alike illimitable! In his presence all other
questions are so petty, that for a public man to be wrong
with regard to him is to be wholly wrong. How, then,
did I err? The cause would have justified a better pertinacity
than I can boast. In the Senate of Rome, the
elder Cato, convinced that peace was possible only by
the destruction of Carthage, concluded all his speeches,
on every matter of debate, by the well-known words:
“But whatever you may think of the question under
consideration, this I know, Carthage must be destroyed.”
I have never read that the veteran Senator was condemned
for the constancy of his patriotic appeal. With
stronger reason far, I, too, might always have cried, “This
I know, Slavery must be destroyed,”&mdash;<i>Delenda<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span> est Servitudo</i>.
But, while seeking to limit and constrain Slavery,
I never proposed anything except in strictest conformity
with the Constitution; for I always recognized

<p>Such are accusations to which I briefly reply. Now
that we are all united in the policy of Emancipation,
they become of little consequence; for, even if I were
once alone, I am no longer so. With me are the loyal
multitudes of the North, now arrayed by the side of the
President, where, indeed, I have ever been.</p>

<p>If you will bear with me yet longer in allusions which
I make with reluctance, I would quote, as my unanswerable
defence, the words of Edmund Burke, when addressing
his constituents at Bristol.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And now, Gentlemen, on this serious day, when I come,
as it were, to make up my account with you, let me take to
myself some degree of honest pride on the nature of the
charges that are against me. I do not here stand before
you accused of venality or of neglect of duty. It is not said,
that, in the long period of my service, I have in a single instance
sacrificed the slightest of your interests to my ambition
or to my fortune. It is not alleged, that, to gratify any
anger or revenge of my own or of my party, I have had a
share in wronging or oppressing any description of men, or
any one man in any description. No! the charges against
me are all of one kind,&mdash;that I have pushed the principles
of general justice and benevolence too far,&mdash;further than a
cautious policy would warrant, and further than the opinions
of many would go along with me. In every accident
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>which may happen through life, in pain, in sorrow, in depression,
and distress, I will call to mind this accusation, and be

<p>Among the passages in eloquence which can never
die, I know none more beautiful or heroic. If I invoke
its protection, it is with the consciousness, that, however
unlike in genius and fame, I am not unlike its author in
the accusations to which I have been exposed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Fellow-citizens, a year has passed since I addressed
you; but, during this time, what events for warning and
encouragement! Amidst vicissitudes of war, the cause
of Human Freedom has steadily and grandly advanced,&mdash;not,
perhaps, as you could desire, yet it is the only
cause which has not failed. Slavery and the Black
Laws all abolished in the national capital; Slavery interdicted
in all the national territory; Hayti and Liberia
recognized as independent republics in the family of
nations; the slave-trade placed under the ban of a new
treaty with Great Britain; all persons in the military
and naval service prohibited from returning slaves, or
sitting in judgment on the claim of a master; the
slaves of Rebels emancipated by coming within our
lines; a tender of compensation for the abolition of
Slavery: such are some of Freedom’s triumphs in the
recent Congress. Amidst all doubts and uncertainties
of the present hour, let us think of these things and
be comforted. I cannot forget, that, when I last spoke
to you, I urged the liberation of the slaves of Rebels,
and especially that our officers should not be permitted
to surrender back to Slavery any human being seeking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
shelter within our lines; and I further suggested, if
need were, a Bridge of Gold for the retreating Fiend.
And now all that I then proposed is embodied in the
legislation of the country as the supreme law of the
land.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was as <em>a military necessity</em> that I urged these measures;
it is as a military necessity that I now uphold
them, and insist upon their completest and most generous
execution, so that they shall have the largest scope
and efficacy. Not as Abolitionist, not as Antislavery
man, not even as philanthropist,&mdash;if I may claim that
honored name,&mdash;do I now speak. I forget, for the moment,
all the unutterable wrong of Slavery, and all the
transcendent blessings of Freedom; for they do not belong
to this argument. I think only of my country
menaced by rebellion, and ask how it shall be saved.
But I have no policy, no theory, no resolutions to support,&mdash;nothing
which I will not gladly abandon, if you
will show me anything better.</p>

<p>And now, what is the object of the war? This question
is often asked, and the answer is not always candid.
It is sometimes said that it is to abolish Slavery. Here
is a mistake, or a misrepresentation. It is sometimes
said, in cant language, that the object is “the Constitution
as it is and the Union as it was.” Here is another
mistake or misrepresentation, which becomes more
offensive when it is known that by “the Constitution as
it is” is meant simply the right to hold and hun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>t slaves,
and by “the Union as it was” is meant those halcyon
days of Proslavery Democracy, when the ballot-box was
destroyed in Kansas, when freedom of debate was menaced
in the Senate, and when chains were put upon the
Boston Court-House. Not for any of these things is
this war waged. Not to abolish Slavery or to establish
Slavery, but simply to put down the Rebellion. And
here the question occurs, How can this object be best
accomplished?</p>

<p>In discussing this question with proper frankness, I
shall develop and vindicate that policy of which the
President’s Proclamation is the herald, and to which his
Administration is publicly pledged. The Administration
belongs to us, and we belong to the Administration.
My aim is to bring the Administration and the people
nearer together, by showing the ground on which they
must meet, for the sake of the Republic, and that it
may not perish beneath felon blows.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I start, of course, with the assumption, in which you
will all unite, that this war must be brought to a close.
It must not be allowed to drag its slow length along,
bloody, and fruitless except with death. Lives enough
have been sacrificed, graves enough have been filled,
homes enough have been emptied, patriot soldiers enough
have been sent back halt and maimed with one leg or
one arm, tears enough have been shed. Nor is this all;
treasure enough has been expended. It is common to
think only of the national debt, now swelling to unnatural
proportions; but this will be small by the side of
the fearful sum-total of loss from destruction of property,
derangement of business, and change of productive
to unproductive industry. Even if we do not accept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
the conclusions of an ingenious calculator who places
this damage at ten thousand millions of dollars, we must
confess that it is an immensity, which, like the numbers
representing sidereal distances, the imagination refuses
to grasp. To stop this infinity of waste there must be
peace; to stop this cruel slaughter there must be peace.
In the old wars between King and Parliament, which
rent England, the generous Falkland cried from his soul,
“<em>Peace! peace!</em>” and history gratefully records his words.
Never did he utter this cry with more earnestness than
I do now. But how shall the blessing be secured?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I start with the further assumption, that there can be
no separation of these States. Foreign nations may predict
what Rebels threaten, but this result is now impossible.
Pray, good Sirs, where will you run the boundary
line? Shall it be the cotton limit? Shall it embrace
Virginia in whole or part? How about Tennessee?
Kentucky? Or shall it be the most natural line of
cleavage, the slave line? And how will you adjust
the navigation of the Mississippi, and the whole question
of Slavery? And what principles, commercial and
political, shall be established between the two Governments?
But do not deceive yourselves into the idea
that peace founded on separation can be anything but a
delusion and a snare. Separation is interminable war,
“never ending, still beginning,”&mdash;worse than the forays
which ravaged the Scottish border, or the Tartar invasions
which harassed China until its famous wall was
built, fifteen hundred miles long, and so thick that six
horsemen ride upon it abreast. War will be chronic,
and we must all sleep on our arms. Better that it be
all at once, rather than diffused over a generation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>. If
blood must be shed, better for a year than for an age.</p>

<p>But if there be anything in the Monroe doctrine, if
we could not accommodate ourselves to the foothold
of Europe upon this continent, how can we recognize
on our borders a malignant Slave empire, with Slavery
as its boasted corner-stone, constituting what Shakespeare
calls “an impudent nation,” embittered and enraged
against us, without law, without humanity, and
without morals,&mdash;a mighty Blue-Beard’s Chamber,&mdash;an
enormous House of Ill-Fame? We would not allow
the old Kingdom of the Assassins to be revived at our
side. But wherein are our Rebels better?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Nor can you recognize such separation without delivering
over this cherished Union to chaos. If the Rebel
States are allowed to go, what can be retained? It is
true, there can be no constitutional right to break up
the Constitution, but the precedent unhappily recognized
would unsettle this whole fabric of States. Therefore,
fellow-citizens, there can be no separation. But
how to prevent it,&mdash;in other words, how to hamstring
the Rebellion and conquer a peace,&mdash;this is the question.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Rebels are in arms, aroused, at home, on their
own soil, and resolved never to yield. Nothing less than
independence will satisfy them: if the war continues, I
know not that they will be content with this. Two policies
are presented on our side,&mdash;one looking primarily
to Rebel conciliation, and the other looking primarily
to Rebel submission. Both have the same elements, although
in diverse order. The first begins with conciliation
in order to end with Rebel submission, which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
cart before horse. The second begins with Rebel submission
in order to end with conciliation. The question
is simply this,&mdash;Whether conciliation shall precede or
follow submission? Conciliation is always proper, where
possible; but, at this stage, it is obviously impossible.
If anybody believes that now any word or act of
conciliation, any forbearance on our part, any hesitation
in exercise of the sternest Rights of War, will
help us to victory or contribute to put down the Rebellion,
let me not enter into that man’s counsels, for
they can end in nothing but shame and disaster. I
find that they who talk most against coercion of Rebels
and coercion of States are indifferent to the coercion
of four million people, men, women, and children, to
work without wages under discipline of the lash. Without
hesitation I say that the Rebels must be subdued,&mdash;call
it coercion or subjugation, whichever you please:
our war has this direct object. With victory will come
conciliation, clemency, amnesty. But first victory.</p>

<p>To obtain victory, two things are needed: first, a precise
comprehension of the case, and, secondly, vigor of
conduct. One will not do without the other. It will
not be enough to comprehend the case, unless you are
ready to treat it with corresponding vigor. And it will
not be enough to have vigor, unless you discern clearly
how the case shall be treated. To this end there must
be statesmen as well as generals.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The first duty of the good physician is to understand
the condition of his patient,&mdash;whether it is a case of
medicine or surgery, of cutaneous eruption or deep-seated
cancer. This is called diagnosis. Of course, if
this fails, the whole treatment will be a failure. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
the statesman, in all the troubles of his country, has
the same preliminary duty. He, too, must see whether
it is a case for medicine or surgery, of cutaneous eruption
or deep-seated cancer. And since all that he does
must be precisely according to his judgment of the case,
error here must be equally fatal.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Next to comprehension of the case is vigor in conduct,
which is more needful in proportion as the case becomes
desperate. This must be not only in the field, but also
in council,&mdash;not only against the serried front of the
enemy, but against those more fatal influences that come
from lack of comprehension or lack of courage. The
same vigor we require in our generals must be required
also in our statesmen,&mdash;the same spirit must animate
both. No folding of the hands, no putting off till to-morrow
what can be done to-day, no hesitation, no timidity,
but <em>action</em>, <em>action</em>, <em>action</em>, straightforward, manly,
devoted action. It is easy to see that this is required
in the field; but it is no less required in every sphere
of the Government, from President to paymaster.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In war there are some who content themselves with
triumphs of prudence instead of triumphs of courage,
and spend much time in trying how not to be beaten,
instead of how to beat. They are content to forego
victory, if they can escape defeat, forgetting that Fabius
was only a defender and not a conqueror, that a
policy fit at one time may be unfit at another, that a
war waged in an enemy’s country cannot be defensive,
nor can it prevail by any procrastination. People at
home, on their own soil, can afford to wait. Every
month, every week, every day is an ally. But we cann<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>ot
wait. No moment must be spared. Not in this
way battled those ancient commanders called “The Two
Thunderbolts of War.” Not in this way did Napoleon
defeat the Austrian forces at Marengo, and shatter the
Prussian power on the field of Jena.</p>

<p>But there are “thunderbolts” of the cabinet as well
as of the field. The elder Pitt, who was only a civilian,
infused his own conquering soul into the British arms,
making them irresistible; and the French Carnot, while
a member of the Committee of Public Safety, was said
to have organized victory. Such is the statesmanship
now needed for us. And there must be generals who
will carry forward all that the most courageous statesmanship
directs.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Armies and men we have of rarest quality. Better
never entered a field or kept step to drum-beat. Intelligent
and patriotic, they have left pleasant homes, to
offer themselves, if need be, for their country. They
are no common hirelings, mere food for powder, but
generous citizens, who have determined that their country
shall be saved. Away in camp, or battle, or hospital,
let them not be forgotten. But, better than gratitude
even, we owe them the protection which comes from
good generals and courageous counsels. O God! let
them not be led to useless slaughter like sheep, nor be
compelled to take the hazard of death from climate and
exposure, as well as from ball and bayonet, without giving
them at once all the allies which can be rallied to
their support. In the name of humanity, and for the
sake of victory, I make this appeal. But the loyal
everywhere are allies. And does loyalty depend upon
color? Is it skin or heart that we consult? Do you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
ask the color of a benefactor? As I listen to people
higgling on the question how to treat Africans coming
to our rescue, I am reminded of that famous incident,
where the Emperor of Austria, driven back by the Turks,
three hundred thousand strong, and besieged in Vienna
until at the point of surrender, was suddenly saved by
the gallant Sobieski of Poland. The Emperor, big with
imperial pride, thought chiefly of his own supereminent
rank,&mdash;as a Proslavery Democrat thinks of his,&mdash;and
hesitated how to receive his Polish benefactor, who was
only an elected king, when the Austrian commander
said: “Sire, receive him as the saviour of your empire.”
The Emperor gave to his saviour hardly more
than a cold salute; and we are told to imitate this
stolid ingratitude.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Wherever I turn in this war, I find the African ready
to be our saviour. If you ask for strategy, I know nothing
better than that of the slave, Robert Small, who brought
the Rebel steamer Planter with its armament out of
Charleston, and surrendered it to our Commodore as
prize of war. If you ask for successful courage, I know
nothing better than that of the African, Tillman, who rose
upon a Rebel prize-crew, and, overcoming them, carried
the ship into New York. If you ask for heroism, you will
find it in that nameless African on board the Pawnee,
who, while passing shell from the magazine, lost both
his legs by a ball, but, still holding a shell, cries out,
“Pass up the shell,&mdash;never mind me; my time is up.”
If you ask for fidelity, you will find it in that slave,
also without a name, who pointed out the road of safety
to the harassed, retreating Army of the Potomac. And
if you ask for evidence of desire for freedom, you will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
find it in the little slave-girl, journeying North, whom
Banks took up on his cannon.</p>

<p>It is now as at earlier stages of our history. The African
is performing his patriotic part, so far as you will
let him. At the famous massacre, when the first blood
of the Revolution reddened the ice-clad pavements of
Boston, Crispus Attucks, an African, once a slave, was
among the victims. At Bunker Hill, where our homely
troops first stood against British valor, Peter Salem, also
an African once a slave, was conspicuous for courage, to
the cost of the royal officer who scaled the rampart, so
that History names him with honor, and Art presents
him in the fore-front of the battle. Trumbull has portrayed
the scene. So long as that picture endures, so
long as that historic battle haunts the memory, you
cannot forget the African fellow-soldier of Prescott and
Warren. But there are others like him, ready now to
do the same service.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Not for the first time do I here make this appeal.
Constantly I have made it before the people and in the
Senate, by speech and proposition. I give an instance,
being a resolution in the Senate, offered May 26th of
this year.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That, in the prosecution of the present war for
the suppression of a wicked Rebellion, the time has come for
the Government of the United States to appeal to the loyalty
of the whole people everywhere, but especially in the
Rebel districts, and to invite all, without distinction of color,
to make their loyalty manifest by ceasing to fight or labor
for the Rebels, and also by rendering every assistance in
their power to the cause of the Constitution and the Union,
according to their ability, whether by arms, or labor, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span> information,
or in any other way; and since protection and
allegiance are reciprocal duties, dependent upon each other,
it is the further duty of the Government of the United
States to maintain all such loyal people, without distinction
of color, in their rights as <em>men</em>, according to the principles
of the Declaration of Independence.”<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

</div>

<p>I need not stop to discuss this resolution. You know
my opinions, and how I have pressed them in debate.
You may also be assured that I have never failed to present
them in that quarter where it was peculiarly important
they should prevail. On the 4th of July of the
present year, in a personal interview with the President,
I said: “You need more men, not only at the North,
but at the South, in the rear of the Rebels: you need
the slaves. Say the word, and you can give to our
armies this invaluable alliance,&mdash;you can change the
rear-guard of the Rebellion into the advance-guard of
the Union. It is now the 4th of July. You can make
this day more sacred and more historic, and do for it
better than the Continental Congress.” Had Emancipation
been spoken at that time, I cannot doubt that the
salvation of our country would have begun thus earlier.
Of course, such a word would have been a blast from
the war-trumpet, justified as a military necessity, according
to examples of history and the heart of man. And
such a blast the President has now blown.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But it is said that all appeal to slaves is unconstitutional;
and it is openly assumed that rebels making
war on the Constitution are not, like other public enemies,
beyond its protection. Why this peculiar te<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>nderness,
whenever Slavery is in question? Battalions may
be shot down, and property taken without due process
of law, but Slavery must not be touched. The ancient
Egyptians, when conquered, submitted easily to loss of
life and property; but when a Roman soldier happened
to kill a cat in the streets, they rose and tore him limb
from limb with such violent excitement that the generals
overlooked the outrage for fear of insurrection. Slavery
is our sacred cat, not to be touched without fear of
insurrection. Sir, I am tired and disgusted at hearing
the Constitution perpetually invoked for Slavery. According
to certain authorities, the Constitution is all for
Slavery and nothing for Freedom. I am proud to own
that with me just the reverse is the case. There are
people who keep apothecaries’ scales, in which they
nicely weigh everything done for Freedom. I have no
such scales, where Freedom is in question, nor do I
hesitate to say that in a case of Freedom all such nicety
is unconstitutional. The Constitution is not mean,
stingy, and pettifogging, but open-handed, liberal, and
just, inclining always in favor of Freedom, and enabling
the Government, in time of war, not only to exercise
any Rights of War, including liberation of slaves, but
also to confer any largess or bounty&mdash;it may be of
money, or, better still, of freedom&mdash;for services rendered.
I do not dwell now on the unanswerable argument
by which John Quincy Adams has placed this
power beyond question.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> Whatever the provisions of
the Constitution for protection of the citizen, they are
inapplicable to what is done against a public enemy.
The law of an Italian city prohibited the letting of
blood under penalty of death; but this did not doom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
the surgeon who opened a vein to save the life of a citizen.
In war there is no constitutional limit to the
activity of the Executive, except the emergency. The
safety of the people is the highest law. There is no
blow the President can strike, there is nothing he can
do against the Rebellion, that is not constitutional.
Only inaction can be unconstitutional.</p>

<p>Some there are who would sacrifice the lives of our
Northern liberty-loving people, and, if this does not save
the Union, then strike Slavery. This again is putting
cart before horse. Slavery should be struck to save
precious blood. The life of a single patriot is worth
more than all Slavery; ay, more, it has stronger securities
in the Constitution.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Search the writers on the Law of Nations, and you
will find the appeal to slaves justified. Search history,
whether in ancient or modern times, and you will find
it justified by example. In our Revolution, this appeal
was made by three different British commanders,&mdash;Lord
Dunmore, Sir Henry Clinton, and Lord Cornwallis. I
do not stop for details. That their appeal was not unsuccessful
is evident from concurring testimony. Its
propriety was admitted by Jefferson, while describing
his own individual losses from Cornwallis.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“He destroyed all my growing crops of corn and tobacco;
he burned all my barns, containing the same articles of the
last year, having first taken what corn he wanted; he used,
<em>as was to be expected</em>, all my stock of cattle, sheep, and hogs,
for the sustenance of his army, and carried off all the horses
capable of service.… <em>He carried off, also, about thirty
slaves. Had this been to give them freedom, he would have
done right.…</em> From an estimate I made at that time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
on the best information I could collect, I supposed the State
of Virginia lost, under Lord Cornwallis’s hands, that year,
about thirty thousand slaves.”<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It would be difficult to imagine testimony stronger.
Here was a sufferer, justly indignant for himself and
his State; but he does not doubt that an enemy would
do right in carrying off slaves to give them freedom.</p>

<p>The enterprise of Lord Dunmore deserves more particular
mention. His proclamation was thus explicit:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And I do hereby further declare all indented servants,
negroes or others (appertaining to rebels), free, that are able
and willing to bear arms, they joining his Majesty’s troops
as soon as may be, for the more speedily reducing this colony
to a proper sense of their duty to his Majesty’s crown
and dignity.”<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Its effect is amply attested. Edmund Pendleton writes
to Richard Henry Lee: “Letters mention that slaves
flock to him in abundance; but I hope it is magnified.”<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>
Lord Dunmore reports to his Government at home: “I
have been endeavoring to raise two regiments here,&mdash;one
of white people, the other of black. The former
goes on very slowly, but the latter very well.”<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> Nothing
shows the consternation more than a letter of Washington,
who, after saying that “Lord Dunmore should
be instantly crushed, if it takes the force of the whole
colony to do it,” proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Otherwise, like a snow-ball in rolling, his army will get
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>size,&mdash;some through fear, some through promises, and some
through inclination joining his standard: but that which
renders the measure indispensably necessary is the negroes;
for, if he gets formidable, numbers of them will be tempted
to join who will be afraid to do it without.”<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>To these authorities add the exclamation of Zubly, in
the Continental Congress from Georgia:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I look on the plan we heard of yesterday to be vile, abominable,
and infernal; but I am afraid it is practicable.”<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Naturally the representative of slave-masters did not
approve it. It is enough that he thought it “practicable.”</p>

<p>Several years later, Lord Dunmore reiterated his sentiments
and vindicated his appeal. This was at Charleston,
where he addressed a communication to Sir Henry
Clinton at New York, under date of February 2, 1782,
in which he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Every one that I have conversed with think&mdash;and, I
must own, my own sentiments perfectly coincide with theirs&mdash;that
the most efficacious, expeditious, cheapest, and certain
means of reducing this country to a proper sense of their
duty is in employing the blacks, who are, in my opinion, not
only better fitted for service in this warm climate than white
men, but they are also better guides, may be got on much
easier terms, and are perfectly attached to our sovereign.
And by employing them, you cannot devise a means more
effectual to distress your foes, not only by depriving them of
their property, but by depriving them of their labor. You
in reality deprive them of their existence; for without their
labor they cannot subsist.”<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<p>These examples, with all this testimony, vindicate our
Proclamation.</p>

<p>There are other instances nearer our own day. During
the last war with England, Admiral Cochrane, commander-in-chief
of the British squadron on the American
station, was openly charged with inviting slaves of
our planters to join the British standard, although the
phraseology of his proclamation was covert, offering
“all those who might be disposed to emigrate from the
United States” service under his Majesty, or encouragement
as “free settlers” in the British possessions.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
Something similar has been anticipated by our own
Government on the coast of Florida, as appears from
an official report.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In the event of war with either of the great European
powers possessing colonies in the West Indies, there would
be danger of the Peninsula of Florida being occupied by
blacks from the islands. A proper regard to the security
of our Southern States requires that prompt and efficient
measures be adopted to prevent such a state of things.”<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Here is distinct recognition of danger from black soldiers,
if employed against us.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Admitting that an appeal to slaves is constitutional,
and also according to examples of history, it is said that
it will be unavailing, for the slaves will not hearken to
it. Then why not try? It can do no harm, and will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
at least give us a good name. But, if not beyond learning
from the enemy, we shall see that the generals most
hated on our side, and, like Adams and Hancock in the
Revolution, specially excepted from pardon, are Phelps
and Hunter, plainly because the ideas of these generals
are more dreaded than any battery or strategy. Of this
be assured: the opponents of this appeal are not anxious
because it will fail; only because it may be successful
do they oppose it. They fear it will reach the
slaves, rather than not reach them.</p>

<p>Look at it candidly, and you cannot deny that it must
produce an effect. It is idle to say that its influence
will be bounded by our jurisdiction. When the mill-gates
are lifted, all the water above, in its most distant
sources, starts on its way; and so will the slaves. Remote
kingdoms trembled at the Pope’s excommunication
and interdict, and an elegant historian has described
the thunders of the Vatican intermingling with the
thunders of war. Christendom shook when Luther
nailed his theses on the church-door of Wittenberg.
An appeal to our slaves will be hardly less prevailing.
Do you ask how it would be known? The fall of
Troy, long before our telegraph, was flashed by beacon-fires
from Mount Ida to Argos. The slave telegraph
is not as active as ours, but it is hardly less sure. It
takes eight days for a despatch from Fortress Monroe
to the Gulf of Mexico. The glad tidings of Freedom
will travel with the wind, with the air, with the light,
quickening and inspiring the whole mass. Secret societies
of slaves, already formed, will be among the operators.
That I do not speak without authority, please
listen to the words of John Adams, taken from his Diary,
under date of 24th September, 1775.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“These gentlemen [Georgia delegates] give a melancholy
account of the state of Georgia and South Carolina. They
say, that, if one thousand regular troops should land in Georgia,
and their commander be provided with arms and clothes
enough, and proclaim freedom to all the negroes who would
join his camp, twenty thousand negroes would join it from
the two provinces in a fortnight. The negroes have a wonderful
art of communicating intelligence among themselves:
it will run several hundreds of miles in a week or fortnight.”<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This is testimony. The destructive avalanche of the
Alps is sometimes started by the winding of a horn, and
a structure so irrational as Slavery will tremble at a
sound.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From such appeal two things must ensue. First, the
slaves will be encouraged in loyalty; and, secondly, the
masters will be discouraged in disloyalty. Slave labor,
which is the mainspring and nursery of Rebel supplies,
without which the Rebellion must starve, will be disorganized,
while a panic spreads among slave-masters absent
from their homes. The most audacious Rebels will
lose their audacity, and, instead of hurrying forward to
deal parricidal blows at their country, will hurry backward
to defend their own firesides. The Rebellion will
lose its power. It will be hamstrung.</p>

<p>That such a panic would ensue is attested by the
confession of the South Carolina delegation in the old
Continental Congress, as appears by its Secret Journal,
under date of 29th March, 1779, that this State was
“<em>unable</em> to make any effectual efforts with militia, by
reason of the great proportion of citizens necessar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>y to
remain at home to prevent insurrections among the negroes,
and to prevent the desertion of them to the enemy.”<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>
It is attested, also, by the concurring testimony
of Southern men in other days, especially in those remarkable
words of John Randolph: “The night-bell
never tolls for fire in Richmond that the frightened
mother does not hug her infant the more closely to
her bosom, not knowing what may have happened.”<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
It is attested also by the actual condition of things
when John Brown entered Virginia, as pictured in familiar
words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“He captured Harper’s Ferry</div>
<div class="verse indent1">With his nineteen men so few,</div>
<div class="verse">And he frightened Old Virginny</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Till she trembled through and through.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Asserting the efficacy of this appeal, I ground myself
on no visionary theories or vain hopes, but on the nature
of man and authentic history. To doubt its efficacy
is to doubt that man is man, with a constant desire for
liberty as for life, and it is also to doubt the unquestionable
instances in our own history where this desire has
been displayed by African slaves. That a government
exposed to the assaults of a merciless barbarian foe
should so long reject this irresistible alliance is among
questions to excite the astonishment of future ages.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>What, then, are the reasons alleged against this appeal?
They all resolve themselves into objections of
fact. The President, by his Proclamation, has already
answered them practically; but I will take the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>m up
in detail.</p>

<p>(1.) The first objection, and most often repeated, is
one which it is difficult to treat with patience. We are
told that the appeal will offend the Border States, and
that, in this moment of trial, we must do as they tell us.
It is, of course, slave-masters who speak for the Border
States; and permit me to say, such persons, continuing
to swear by Slavery, are not competent witnesses. Believing
in Slavery, wedded to Slavery, they are as incompetent
to testify as husband and wife are incompetent
to testify for each other. Just in proportion as we follow
them we are misled, and we shall continue to be
misled so long as we follow them. Their influence is
perpetual paralysis. Nobody can counsel safely at this
moment who adheres to Slavery, or fails to see Slavery
as the origin and mainspring of the Rebellion. It is
well known that for a long time in England all efforts
against Slavery, led by Wilberforce and Clarkson, were
discountenanced and opposed by the slave-masters in
the distant islands. Whatever the proposition, whether
to abridge, to mitigate, or ameliorate, there was always
one steady dissent. Put not your trust in slave-masters,&mdash;do
not hearken to their promises,&mdash;do not follow
their counsels. Such is the plain lesson of English
history, of French history, of Dutch history, of every
country which has dealt with this question,&mdash;ay, of
Russian history at this very moment,&mdash;and such, also,
is the positive caution of English statesmen. On this
point we have the concurring testimony of three names,
each of which is an authority. It is all embodied in a
brief passage of a speech by Lord Brougham.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I entirely concur in the observation of Mr. Burke, repeated
and more happily expressed by Mr. Canning, that the
masters of slaves are not to be trusted with making laws
upon Slavery,&mdash;that nothing they do is ever found effectual,&mdash;and
that, if by some miracle they ever chance to enact a
wholesome regulation, it is always found to want what Mr.
Burke calls <em>the executory principle</em>,&mdash;it fails to execute itself.”<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

</div>

<p>These are emphatic words, and as often as I am reminded
of the opinions of Slave-Masters on our present
duties, when Slavery is in question, I think of them as
a solemn warning, confirmed by all the teachings of experience
in our own country, early and late.</p>

<p>(2.) Another objection is, that officers in our army
will fling down their arms. Very well,&mdash;let the traitors
fling down their arms: the sooner, the better. They
are unworthy to bear arms, and should be delivered
up to the hissing and execration of mankind. But I
will not dishonor officers with the commission of the
United States by such imputation on their loyalty
and common sense. As officers they must know their
duty too well, and as intelligent men they must know
that the slaves are calculated to be their best and surest
allies.</p>

<p>(3.) Another objection is, that Slavery is a “side issue,”
not to be touched until the war is ended. But
these wise objectors forget that it is precisely in order
to end the war that Slavery is to be touched, and
that, when they oppose the effort, they make a “side
issue” in its behalf, calculated to weaken the national
arm.</p>

<p>(4.) Another objection has its origin in pity, that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>Rebels may be saved from a slave insurrection. God
forbid that I should fail in any duty of humanity, or
tenderness even; but I know no principle of war or of
reason by which our Rebels should be saved from the
natural consequences of their own conduct. When they
rose against a paternal Government, they set the example
of insurrection which has carried death to innumerable
firesides. They cannot complain, if their slaves,
with better reason, follow it. According to an old law,
bloody inventions return to plague the inventor. But
this whole objection proceeds on a mistaken idea of the
African slave. The story of San Domingo, so often
quoted against him, testifies to his humanity. Only
when Napoleon, in an evil hour, sought to reënslave
him, did those scenes of blood occur, which exhibit less
the cruelty of the slave than the atrocious purpose of
the white man. The African is not cruel, vindictive, or
harsh, but gentle, forgiving, and kind. Such is authentic
history. Nor does it appear, when the slaves left
their masters, on the appeal of the British commanders,
during our Revolution, that they were guilty of any excess.
It is true that labor was disorganized, and the
whole community weakened; and this is what we seek
to accomplish in the Rebel States.</p>

<p>(5.) And yet one more objection is sometimes advanced.
It is said that an appeal to the slaves will
make them overflow into the North, where they will
compete with other labor. This ill-considered and trivial
objection subordinates the suppression of the Rebellion
to a question of labor, and, by a “side issue,” diverts
attention from the great object at heart. But it becomes
absurd, when you consider, as every candid observer
must admit, that no such objection can arise. There
is no danger of any such overflow. It is precisely <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>the
pressure of Slavery, and not the license of Freedom,
that causes overflow. If Slavery were removed, the
Africans would flow back, instead of overflowing here.
The South is their natural home, and there they will go
when justice at last prevails.</p>

<p>Such are the objections of fact, so far as any exist
within my knowledge. If any other has been made,
I do not know it. I ask you frankly, have I not answered
them?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But, fellow-citizens, I shall not leave the argument
at this stage. It is not enough to show that slaves can
render important assistance, by labor, by information, or
by arms, and that there is no reasonable objection to
calling upon them, with other loyalists, in support of the
Union. The case is stronger still. <em>Without the aid of
the slaves this war cannot be ended successfully.</em> Their
alliance is, therefore, a necessity. In making this assertion
I know well the responsibility I assume, nor do I
assume it lightly. But the time has come when the
truth must be told. Let me be understood. As war
is proverbially uncertain, I cannot doubt that fortune
will again light upon our arms. The force of the Rebellion
may be broken even without appeal to the slaves.
But I am sure that with the slaves our victory will be
more prompt, while without them it can never be effectual
completely to crush out the Rebellion. It is not
enough to beat armies. Rebel communities, envenomed
against the Union, must be restored, and a wide-spread
region quieted. This can be done only by removal of
the disturbing cause, and the consequent assimilation
of the people, so that no man shall call another master.
If Slavery be regarded as a disease, it must be extir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>pated
by knife and cautery; for only in this way can
the healthful operations of national life be regained. If
regarded as a motive, it must be expelled from the system,
that it may no longer exercise its malign influence.
So long as Slavery continues, the States in which it exists
will fly madly from the Union, but with its destruction
they will lose all such tendency. The Slave States,
by the influence of Slavery, are now <em>centrifugal</em>; but
with Slavery out of the system, they will be <em>centripetal</em>.
Such is the law of their being. And it should be our
present policy to take advantage of this law for the
benefit of the Union. Nay, from the necessity of the
case, this must be done.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A united people cannot be conquered. Defeated on
the battle-field, they will remain sullen and revengeful,
ready for another rebellion. This is the lesson of history.
Even Hannibal, after crushing in the field all the
armies of Rome, and ranging at will throughout Italy,
was obliged to confess the inadequacy of his triumphs,
while he appealed for help to the subjects of Rome, exciting
them to insurrection, and arousing them against
the Roman power. To this long-cherished plan were
directed all the energies he could spare from battle, believing
that in this way his enemy could be brought
under a double fire. But it is known that the people
of the Slave States are not wholly united, and that
among them are large numbers ready at call to uphold
the Union. From the beginning of the war, we
have assumed, as an element of strength, the presence
there of large numbers devoted to the Union, ready at
the proper moment to coöperate with the national forces.
Yet most of these faithful Unionists are not white. T<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>he
Unionists of the South are black. Let these be rallied,
and the Rebellion will be exposed not only to a fire in
front, but also to a fire in the rear. The two together
are necessary to the operations of war. The Union
army thus far is like a single blade of a pair of scissors,
which, though of choicest steel with sharpest edge,
must be comparatively useless. Let the other blade be
conjoined, and the instrument will be perfect. The scissors
of Fate could not cut more surely.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Is not our duty clear? And is not the President
completely vindicated? By Emancipation we not only
hasten the war to a close, but we give it an effective
<em>finality</em>, preventing it from breaking forth anew, which
can be obtained in no other way. The heads of the
hydra will be extirpated and the monster destroyed,
never more to show itself. Without Emancipation the
whole contest is delivered over to present uncertainty,
while the future is left to glare with all the horrors of
civil strife unsuppressed. The last chapter of “Rasselas”
is entitled “The Conclusion, in which Nothing is Concluded”;
and this will be the proper title for the history
of this war, if Slavery is allowed to endure. If you
would trample down the Rebellion, you must trample
down Slavery; and, believe me, it must be completely
done. Among the terrible pictures in the immortal
poem of Dante, where crime on earth is portrayed in
so many fearful punishments, is that of Caiaphas, high-priest
of the Jews, who, as penalty for his sacrifice of
the Saviour, was stretched on the floor of Hell, where
all who passed must tread on him.</p>

<p>Such should be the final fate of Slavery, naked and dishonored,
stretched where all may tread upon it. Never
can the Rights of War be employed more justly than to
create this doom.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was easy to see from the beginning that the Rebellion
had its origin in Slavery,&mdash;that without Slavery
it never could have broken forth,&mdash;that, when begun, it
was continued only through Slavery,&mdash;that Slavery was
at once the curse that pursued, the principle that governed,
and the power that sustained,&mdash;and the Oligarchy
of slave-masters, three hundred and fifty thousand all
told, were the criminals through whom all this direful
wickedness was organized and waged. Such is the unquestionable
diagnosis of the case, which history will
recognize, and a wise statesmanship must have seen
promptly. Not to see Slavery in this guilty character
was a mistake, and grievously have we answered for it.
All are agreed now that Buchanan played into Rebel
hands, when, declaring that there can be no coercion of
a State, he refused to touch the Rebellion. Alas! alas!
we, too, may play into Rebel hands, when, out of strange
and incomprehensible forbearance, we refuse to touch
Slavery, which is the very life of the Rebellion. Pardon
these allusions, made in no spirit of criticism, but simply
that I may accumulate new motives for that Proclamation
which I rejoice to welcome as herald of peace.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There are many generals already in the field,&mdash;upwards
of thirty major-generals, and two hundred brigadiers;
but, meritorious and brave as they may be,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
there is a general better than all, whom the President
now commissions,&mdash;I mean General Emancipation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is common to speak of God as on the side of the
heavy battalions. Whatever the truth of this saying, it
does not contain the whole truth. Heavy battalions are
something, but they are not everything. Even if prevailing
on the battle-field, which is not always the case,
the victory they compel is not final. It is impotent to
secure that tranquillity essential to national life. Mind
is above matter, right is more than force, and it is vain
to attempt conquest merely by matter or by force. If
this can be done in small affairs, it cannot in large; for
these yield only to moral influences. Napoleon was the
great master of war, and yet, from his utterances at St.
Helena, the legacy of his transcendent experience, comes
this confession: “The more I study the world, the more
am I convinced of the inability of <em>brute force</em> to create
anything durable.” And another Frenchman, of subtile
thought and perfect integrity, whose name is linked
forever with American institutions, De Tocqueville, has
paid a similar tribute to truth. “Force,” says he, “is
never more than a transient element of success. A government
only able to crush its enemies on the field of
battle would very soon be destroyed.” In these authoritative
words of the warrior and the thinker there is
warning not to put trust in batteries or bayonets, while
an unconquerable instinct makes us confess that might
cannot constitute right.</p>

<p>Let the war end on the battle-field alone, and it will
be only in appearance that it will end, not in reality.
Time will be gained for new efforts, and Slavery will
coil itself to spring again. The Rebellion may seem to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
be vanquished, and yet it will triumph. The Union
may seem to conquer, and yet it will succumb. The
Republic may seem to be saved, and yet it will be lost,&mdash;handed
over a prey to that injustice which, so long
as it exists, must challenge the judgments of a righteous
God.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thus, for the sake of peace, which we all desire, do I
now plead for Freedom, through which alone peace can
be secured. Are you earnest for peace? then must you
be earnest for Freedom also. Would you uphold the
Union against treason? then must you uphold Freedom,
without which bloody treason will flourish over
us. But Freedom is adopted by Congress and proclaimed
by the President as one of the agencies in the
prosecution of the war. Therefore it must be maintained
with all our souls and all our hearts and all
our might. The hour of debate has passed, the hour
of action has sounded. In opposing solemn Acts of
Congress, which, according to the Constitution, are now
the supreme law of the land, passed for the national
defence,&mdash;in opposing the Proclamation of the President,&mdash;nay,
in discouraging Freedom,&mdash;you are as
bad as if you discouraged enlistments. It is through
Freedom, as well as arms, that the war will be waged;
and the same loyalty that supports the one is now
due to the other. The discouragement of enlistments
is recognized as seditious and traitorous; but the discouragement
of this new force, adopted by the Government
for the suppression of the Rebellion, is only
another form of sedition and treason, which an indignant
patriotism will spurn. Emancipation is now a
war measure, to be sustained as you sustain an army<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
in the field.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If the instincts of patriotism did not prompt this support,
I should find a sufficient motive in that duty which
we all owe to the Supreme Ruler, God Almighty, whose
visitations upon our country are now so fearful. Not
rashly would I make myself the interpreter of His will;
and yet I am not blind. According to a venerable
maxim of jurisprudence, “Whoso would have equity
must do equity”; and God plainly requires equity at
our hands. We cannot expect success while setting at
nought this requirement, proclaimed in His divine character,
in the dictates of reason, and in the examples of
history,&mdash;proclaimed, also, in the events of this protracted
war. Terrible judgments have fallen upon the
country: plagues have been let loose, rivers have been
turned into blood, and there is a great cry throughout
the land, for there is not a house where there is not one
dead; and at each judgment we seem to hear that terrible
voice which sounded in the ears of Pharaoh: “Thus
saith the Lord God of the Hebrews, Let my people go,
that they may serve me.” I know not how others are
touched, but I cannot listen to the frequent tidings of
calamity descending upon our arms, of a noble soldier
lost to his country, of bereavement at the family hearth,
of a youthful son brought home dead to his mother,
without catching the warning, “Let my people go!”
Nay, every wound, every sorrow, every hardship, all
that we are compelled to bear in taxation, in want, in
derangement of business, has a voice crying, “Let my
people go!”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>
<p>And now, thank God, the word is spoken!&mdash;greater
word was seldom spoken. Emancipation has begun, and
our country is already elevated and glorified. The war
has not changed in <em>object</em>, but it has changed in <em>character</em>.
Its object now, as at the beginning, is simply to
put down the Rebellion; but its character is derived
from the new force at length enlisted, stamping itself
upon all that is done, and absorbing the whole war to
itself. Vain will it be again to delude European nations
into foolish belief that Slavery has nothing to do
with the war, that it is a war for empire on one side and
independence on the other, and that all generous ideas
are on the side of the Rebellion. And vain, also, will be
that other European cry,&mdash;whether from an intemperate
press or the cautious lips of statesmen,&mdash;that separation
is inevitable, and that our Government is doomed
to witness the dismemberment of the Republic. With
this new alliance, such forebodings will be falsified, the
wishes of the fathers will be fulfilled, and the rights of
human nature, which were the declared object of our
Revolution, vindicated. Thus inspired, the sword of
Washington&mdash;that sword which, according to his last
will and testament, was to be drawn only in self-defence,
or in defence of country and its rights&mdash;will once more
marshal our armies to victory, while the national flag,
wherever it floats, will give freedom to all beneath its
folds, and the proud inscription be at last triumphantly
verified: “Liberty and Union, now and forever, one and
inseparable.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But, fellow-citizens, the war we wage is not merely
for ourselves, it is for all mankind. Slavery yet lingers
in Brazil, and beneath the Spanish flag in those two
golden possessions, Cuba and Porto Rico; but nowhere
can it survive extinction here. Therefore we conquer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
for Liberty everywhere. In ending Slavery here we
open its gates all over the world, and let the oppressed
go free. Nor is this all. In saving the Republic we save
Civilization. Man throughout his long pilgrimage on
earth has been compelled to suffer much, but Slavery
is the heaviest burden he has been called to bear: it is
the only burden our country has been called to bear.
Let it drop, and this happy Republic, with humanity
in its train, all changed in raiment and in countenance,
like the Christian Pilgrim, will hurry upward to the
celestial gate. If thus far our example has failed, it
is simply because of Slavery. Vain to proclaim our
unparalleled prosperity, the comfort diffused among a
numerous people, resources without stint, or even the
education of our children; the enemies of the Republic
had but to say, “There is Slavery,” and our example
became powerless. But let Slavery disappear, and the
same example will be of irresistible might. Without
firing a gun or writing a despatch, it will revolutionize
the world.</p>

<p>Therefore the battle we fight belongs to the grandest
events of history. It constitutes one of those epochs
from which humanity will date. It is one of the battles
of the ages, as when the millions of Persia were hurled
back from Greece, or when the Mohammedans, victors
in Africa and Spain, were hurled back from France by
Charles Martel, and Western Europe was saved to Christianity.
In such a cause no effort too great, no faith
too determined. To die for country is pleasant and
honorable. But all who die for country now die also for
humanity. Wherever they lie in bloody fields, they will
be remembered as heroes through whom the Republic
was saved and civilization established forever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>But there are duties elsewhere than in bloody conflict.
Each of us, in his place at home, by his best efforts, can
do something, not only to sustain the soldier in the field,
but also to uphold that sublime edict which will be to
the soldier both sword and buckler, while it gives to the
conflict all the grandeur of a great idea. In this hour
of trial let none fail. Above all, let none go over to the
enemy, even should his tents for the moment be pitched
in Faneuil Hall,<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> assured that there can be but two parties:
the party of our country, with the President for
its head, and Emancipation its glorious watchword; and
the party of Rebellion, with Jefferson Davis for its
head, and no other watchword than Slavery.</p>

<h4>NOMINATION AND REËLECTION OF MR. SUMNER.</h4>

<div class="medium">

<p>As this speech was made in the midst of the excitement in Massachusetts
on the nomination of Mr. Sumner as Senator, an account of
that contest will not be out of place here.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The early and active part taken by Mr. Sumner in favor of Emancipation,
and the urgency of his efforts against Slavery, excited against
him an intense opposition, not only in Massachusetts, but throughout
the country. He was denounced as second only to Jefferson Davis in
hostility to the Constitution. But these attacks aroused the friends
of Emancipation, who were unwilling to see their representative sacrificed.</p>

<p>There were signs of this contest in the autumn of 1861, when Mr.
Sumner called for Emancipation as our best weapon.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> Governor Andrew
saw it coming. In a letter, dated June 9, 1862, with reference
to the appointment of officers in the Internal Revenue Bureau, he used
the following language.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Hunkers will make the most strenuous efforts to secure a large representation
in this agency, so that, by means of their influence with the
people (and in travelling from town to town), they can poison the minds of
prominent citizens against you, and accomplish your defeat by securing a
Legislature favorable to their purposes.</p>

<p>“Depend upon it, that they are calculating largely upon the Tax Bill as
an element in their desperate ‘strategy’ for the fall campaign.”</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>New York Tribune</i>, in a vigorous article, June 24, 1862, entitled
“Mr. Sumner’s Seat,” set forth reasons “why many earnest Republicans
in other States would regret the retirement of Mr. Sumner.”
Here it said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Most of our Republican statesmen have a political history antecedent to
ou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>r existing organizations. Mr. Sumner, nearly alone, is nowhere regarded
as having Whig or Democratic predilections, but as purely and wholly Republican.</p>

<p>“Other statesmen, however profoundly Republican, regard collateral
questions with an observing interest: the Tariff, the Currency, the Pacific
Railroad, &amp;c., largely engross their attention. Mr. Sumner profoundly
believes it of paramount, absorbing interest that the nation should be just,
even to her humblest, most despised children, and that Righteousness is the
essential condition of material and other prosperity. Never inattentive to
or neglectful of any public duty, never even accused of sacrificing or opposing
the interest of Massachusetts in any matter of legislation, he is yet known
to believe that her interests can never be truly promoted by sacrificing those
of Humanity. In an age of venality and of uncharitable suspicion, he was
never even suspected of giving a mercenary or selfish vote; in an atmosphere
where every man is supposed to have his price, and to be scheming and
striving for self-aggrandizement, no man ever suggested that Charles Sumner
was animated by sinister impulses, or that he would barter or stifle his
convictions for the Presidency. The one charge brought against him by his
many bitter adversaries imports that he is a <em>fanatic</em>,&mdash;not that it was ever
imagined that he is the special devotee of any fane or sect, but that he sincerely
believes it the end of civil government to hasten the coming of God’s
earthly kingdom by causing His justice to pervade every act, every relation,
and thus making the earth, so far as human imperfection will permit, a
vestibule of heaven.”</p>

</div>

<p>In warning against possible combination to defeat his reëlection, the
article said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“All that the Republicans of other States can and do ask is, that no back-stairs
intrigue, no chimney-corner arrangement, shall send to Boston a Legislature
secretly pledged to oust him, and elected by constituencies profoundly
ignorant of any such manipulation.… All we ask is, that those who vote
at the polls to supersede Mr. Sumner in the Senate shall know for what they
vote, and not be duped by professions only made to deceive.”</p>

</div>

<p>The adverse spirit showed itself at a large public meeting in New
York, July 1st, which was entitled by the <i>Herald</i>, “The Anti-Abolition
and Anti-Secession Movement.&mdash;Disunion the Fruit of Abolition.”
Here Hon. William Duer, of Oswego, seemed to become the
mouthpiece of the excited multitude.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“No emancipation and turning loose upon them hordes of uncivilized and
ignorant Africans.… No tyrant in history has ever made his name execrated
by measures more despicable than such as those proposed by the
Abolitionists for the humiliation and destruction of the South. The Southern
people have been deluded by their leaders in the same way as the Northern
people, and, in his opinion, the next man who walked up the scaffold
after Jefferson Davis should be Charles Sumner. [<i>Loud and long-continued
applause, mingled with hooting and groans for Sumner. Some person in the
meeting attempted to say a word in his favor, but his voice was quickly drowned
in loud shouts of ‘Put him out!’</i>]”</p>

</div>

<p>Th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>is is from the <i>Herald</i>. The same incident is thus reported in the
<i>Tribune</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And if we came to hanging every traitor in this country in the order of
their guilt, the next man who marched upon the scaffold after Jefferson Davis
would be Charles Sumner. [<i>Loud applause, the greatest of the evening
thus far. Groans for Sumner. Great excitement. Cries of ‘Put him out!’
Cries, ‘Where is Horace Greeley?’</i>]”</p>

</div>

<p>A correspondent of a Boston paper, taking up the strain, echoed it
for the benefit of Massachusetts.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“There are now two war-cries in New York, and the great Union mastiff
is as ready to pounce upon one of the brutes as upon the other. If there are
two parties outside of the doomed radicals, they are those, the most violent
of them, who would hang Jeff. Davis and Sumner together, and those who
would hang Davis first and Sumner afterwards.</p>

<p>“If Sumner is reëlected to the Senate, he may not find it convenient to
pass through this city. That his name is odious, infamous, is not all,&mdash;it
is cursed and abominable. The blood of thousands sacrificed to his ambition
and personal revenge cries to Heaven against him, and if a Massachusetts
Legislature can still support him by its vote, those who do so will deserve
to lose their children at the altar of this Moloch.”</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>New York Herald</i> followed with a leader, July 16th, entitled,
“Senators Wade and Sumner,” which, after announcing that the
terms of these Senators would expire on the 4th of March next, made
the following appeal.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“By the foulest means they have succeeded in clogging the wheels of our
progress in the war, and have made another year of battles unavoidable.
Had it not been for them and their coadjutors, the war would have been over
and the Union restored on the Fourth of July instant. More than any other
men they are responsible for the useless sacrifice of blood and treasure in the
past, and for the three hundred thousand more men and five hundred millions
more dollars which will have to be perilled in the future. Practically, and
in the most emphatic sense, they are traitors to the country and enemies of
the nation. From them, more than from a thousand Vallandighams, Jeff.
Davis has received aid and comfort; for they have strengthened his forces
by exasperating the South and by dividing and weakening the North. We
hope that the loyal men of Massachusetts and Ohio will raise these questions
in the coming elections for State legislators, and vote down every man who
is pledged or who intends to vote for the reëlection of these twin traitors,
Sumner and Wade. They have only escaped Fort Lafayette and the gallows
because the Government has distrusted its own power and misunderstood
the sentiments of the loyal people. Let this misunderstanding now end, and
let Messrs. Sumner and Wade find, when they return to their homes, that
they are held personally and politically responsible for their infamous and
treasonable course.”</p>

</div>

<p>Th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>e friends of Emancipation in Massachusetts were not inactive.
The issue thus presented was accepted by the formal nomination of
Mr. Sumner, at the annual Republican State Convention at Worcester,
September 10th.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Convention was organized by the choice of the following officers.</p>

<p><i>President</i>,&mdash;Hon. Alexander H. Bullock of Worcester.</p>

<p><i>Vice-Presidents</i>,&mdash;District 1, Nathaniel Coggswell of Yarmouth; District
2, J. H. D. Blake of Braintree; District 3, Theodore Otis of Roxbury;
District 4, Nehemiah Boynton of Chelsea; District 5, Timothy
Davis of Gloucester; District 6, George Foster of Andover; District
7, Chauncey L. Knapp of Lowell; District 8, Valorous Taft of Upton;
District 9, Joel Hayden of Williamsburg; District 10, George L. Wright
of West Springfield. <i>At Large</i>,&mdash;John Bertram of Salem, George Morey
of Boston, Tappan Wentworth of Lowell, Ensign H. Kellogg of
Pittsfield, Charles G. Davis of Plymouth, Henry Alexander, Jr., of
Springfield.</p>

<p><i>Secretaries</i>,&mdash;Stephen N. Stockwell of Boston, William M. Walker
of Pittsfield, Joseph B. Thaxter, Jr., of Hingham, William T. Hollis
of Plymouth, Thomas B. Gardner of Boston, Joel Hayden, Jr., of Williamsburg.</p>

<p>John A. Andrew was re-nominated for Governor by acclamation. J.
Q. A. Griffin, of Charlestown, introduced a resolution approving the
course of the two Senators, and nominating Mr. Sumner for reëlection
as Senator, and at the same time said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Remember, it is our duty not only to sustain the arms of the Generals
in the field, but likewise to sustain the President in his seat, the Cabinet in
its counsels, the Governor in his chair, and, <em>above all, the fearless legislator
in his duty</em>. [<i>Loud applause, and cries of ‘Good!’</i>]”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Griffin was followed by Frederick Robinson, of Marblehead, who
hoped that the resolution would be adopted unanimously, and also another,
expressing the opinion of Massachusetts in favor of Emancipation.
George F. Hoar, of Worcester, agreed with Mr. Robinson. As to
the resolution approving Charles Sumner and Henry Wilson, “he liked
that,” but he wished, also, “an expression of the opinion of this Convention,
that it is the duty of the United States Government, in the
further prosecution of the war, to strike the Rebellion where it is weakest.”
The different propositions were then referred to a committee.
At this stage the letter of Mr. Sumner to the Convention was presented
and read by Mr. Claflin.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>Among the resolutions subsequently reported were the two following.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That the most decisive measures for the complete and permanent
suppression of this Rebellion are the most prudent, and that, as the
institution of Slavery is a principal support of it, that institution shall be
exterminated.”</p>

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That we recognize and acknowledge the preëminent merits
and services of our Senators in the Congress of the United States, the Hon.
Charles Sumner and the Hon. Henry Wilson. In the posts of duty assigned
them by the suffrages of their brother Senators, one as Chairman of the
Committee on Foreign Relations, and the other as Chairman of the Committee
on Military Affairs, they have cordially and unreservedly, and with masterly
ability, supported all governmental measures, and fitly represented the
Commonwealth as among the most cheerful and enthusiastic defenders of
the Government. And now that the second term of our senior Senator is
drawing to a close, we desire to express our warm approbation of his course
and appreciation of his services, and to commend him to the suffrages of his
fellow-citizens, whom he has served so well, that the Commonwealth may
again honor itself by returning to duty at the capital a statesman, a scholar,
a patriot, and a man of whom any republic in any age might be proud.”</p>

</div>

<p>The whole series, as read, was received with intense enthusiasm, especially
that against Slavery. A motion was made to amend by striking
out that part recommending the reëlection of Mr. Sumner, which was
voted down promptly, and the resolution was unanimously adopted.</p>

<p>The action of the Convention presented two distinct issues,&mdash;first,
the extermination of Slavery, and, secondly, the reëlection of Mr. Sumner.
There was at once a counter movement. A call was put forth for
what was called a “People’s Convention,” at Faneuil Hall, October 7th,
whose main object was to defeat the action of the Republican Convention,
and especially the reëlection of Mr. Sumner. It was supposed that
in this way all the elements of opposition could be united. This plan
received an unexpected check by the Proclamation of Emancipation of
September 22d. It could no longer be said that the Republican Party
of Massachusetts and Mr. Sumner were not in entire harmony with the
President.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mr. Sumner addressed his fellow-citizens at Faneuil Hall,
October 6th, in vindication of the Proclamation. On the succeeding day
the “People’s Convention” assembled in the same place and nominated
candidates for State offices in opposition to the Republicans. The tone
of this Convention appears in a brief extract from the speech of Hon.
Josiah G. Abbott, of Boston. After alluding to the various interests of
Massachusetts, he said:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And I tell you, Gentlemen,&mdash;and every heart here responds to it,&mdash;every
heart out of this hall would respond to it, if the lips would speak the
language of the heart,&mdash;I tell you, Gentlemen, we want men in the Halls of
Congress, in the House of Representatives, and, above and beyond all, in
the Senate Chamber, who will attend to those interests, and not be continually,
as they have been, Sir, attending to mere wild speculations and sentimental
theories. [<i>Applause.</i>] Do not the people cry out, ’For God’s sake,
give us somebody who believes there is something to be attended to in the
wants of a million and a quarter of white men, women, and children’?
[<i>Great applause.</i>]”</p>

</div>

<p>The spirit of this Convention was thus described by the <i>Norfolk
County Journal</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The partisanship of the People’s Convention all centres in opposition to
Charles Sumner. It is as pure an instance of personal hate on the part of
its leaders as was ever exhibited. <em>This animosity comes solely from the fact
that he was the earliest and has been the most persistent advocate of what is
now the policy of the nation.</em> They hate Mr. Sumner, not because he is personally
unamiable, not because there is a flaw in his moral character or a
doubt as to the purity of his intentions, not because he has not represented
the opinion of Massachusetts, and faithfully advocated her best interests on
every point affecting her material prosperity. They have commenced this
personal crusade <em>solely</em> because he has been the most conspicuous and uncompromising
foe to the encroachments of Southern Slavery. And now that
the President has ranged himself on Mr. Sumner’s side, in opposing him
they oppose the Administration.”</p>

</div>

<p>On the next day, the Democratic Convention at Worcester adopted
the nominations of the “People’s Convention,” so that the elements of
opposition seemed to be united. The President of the Convention in
his remarks announced the common object.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Let me, then, appeal to you to come here with one heart and with kindly
feelings towards all, entertaining respect for the opinions of all, so that, when
this Convention shall have adjourned, a voice will go forth throughout this
Commonwealth, that the day of John A. Andrew and Charles Sumner is
ended. [<i>Prolonged cheers.</i>]”</p>

</div>

<p>Other speeches followed in the same tone, and insisting upon union
“to beat Sumner and Andrew.”</p>

<p>The issue was thus presented to the people of Massachusetts, and
throughout the Commonwealth the election of Senators and Representatives
turned mainly upon it. If the attack was vigorous, so also was
the defence. Of the latter a few illustrations will suffice. The first is
from Wendell Phillips, who, in an address at Music Hall, Sunday forenoon,
November 2d, said:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I say this much, before turning again to my immediate subject, for our
great Senator, who has done justice to the manufacturing interests and the
shipping of Massachusetts, as Webster did, and also justice to her conscience
and her thought, as Webster did not. [<i>Applause.</i>] I do not wish to take
one leaf from the laurel of the great Defender of the Constitution; he rests at
Marshfield, beneath the honors he fairly earned. But we have put in his place
a man far more practical than he was; we have put in his place the hardest
worker that Massachusetts ever sent to the Senate of the United States [<i>applause</i>];
we have put in his place the Stonewall Jackson of the floor of the
Senate,&mdash;patient of labor, untiring in effort, boundless in resources, terribly
in earnest,&mdash;the only man who, in civil affairs, is to be compared with the
great terror of the Union armies, the General of the Virginia forces: both
ideologists, both horsed on an idea, and both men whom a year ago the
drudges of State Street denounced, or would have denounced, as unpractical
and impracticable; but when the war-bugle sounded through the land, both
were found to be the only men to whom Carolina and Massachusetts hasted
to give the batons of the opposing hosts.”</p>

</div>

<p>John G. Whittier, whose words of flame had done so much in the
long warfare with Slavery, was aroused from his retirement to testify.
In the Amesbury <i>Villager</i>, near his home, he wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In looking over the speeches and newspapers of his active opponents, it
really seems to me, that, if ever a man was hated and condemned for his very
virtues, it is this gentleman. Nobody accuses him of making use of his high
position for his own personal emolument; no shadow of suspicion rests upon
the purity of his private or public character; no man can point to an instance
in which he has neglected any duty properly devolving upon him;
no interest of his State has been forgotten or overlooked; no citizen has appealed
to him in vain for kindly offices and courteous hearing and attention.
As Chairman of the Committee of Foreign Affairs, his industry and
ability have never been denied by his bitterest enemies. All admit that he
has rendered important service to his Government. What, then, is his crime?
Simply and solely this, that he stands inflexibly by his principles,&mdash;that
he is too hearty in his hatred of the monstrous Wrong which initiated and
still sustains the present Rebellion,&mdash;that in advance of his contemporaries
he saw the danger and proclaimed it,&mdash;that he heartily sustains the President
in his Proclamation,&mdash;that he is in favor of destroying the guilty
cause of all our national calamities, that red-handed murderer and traitor
against whom the sighs and groans of Massachusetts wives and mothers,
weeping in every town and hamlet for dear ones who are not, are rising in
swift witness to God.</p>

<p>“This is his crime, his real offence, in the eyes of his leading opponents.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>I know it has been said that he is too much a man of ideas, and not a statesman.
That he is not a politician, in the modern sense of the word, I admit;
and if indirection, trickery, and the habit of looking upon men, parties, and
principles as mere stock in trade and tools of convenience are the qualifications
of statecraft, then he is not a statesman. But if a thorough comprehension
of the great principles of law and political economy, of all which
constitutes the true honor and glory and prosperity of a people,&mdash;if the will
and ability to master every question as it arises,&mdash;if entire familiarity with
the history, resources, laws, and policy of other nations, derived not merely
from the study of books, but from free personal intercourse with the leading
minds of Europe, are essential requisites of statesmanship, then is Charles
Sumner a statesman in the noblest and truest sense. Certain it is that he is
so regarded by the diplomatic representatives of European nations, and that
no man in the country has so entirely the confidence and esteem of all who
are really our friends in the Old World.”</p>

</div>

<p>Horace Greeley, in an article under his own name in the New York
<i>Independent</i>, and entitled, “Charles Sumner as a Statesman,” united
with the Republicans of Massachusetts.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“For the first time in our political history, a party has been organized and
a State ticket nominated for the sole purpose of defeating the reëlection of
one who is not a State officer, and never aspired to be. Governor Andrew
is regarded with a hostility intensified by the fewness of those who feel it;
but the bitterness with which Mr. Sumner is hated insists on the gratification
of a canvass, even though a hopeless one; and, since there was no existing
party by which this could be attempted without manifest futility, one
was organized for the purpose. And it was best that this should be. Let
us have a census of the friends and the enemies of Mr. Sumner in the State
which he has so honored.</p>

<p>“I have said, that, while other Senators have shared his convictions, none
has seemed so emphatically, so eminently, as he to embody and represent
the growing, deepening Antislavery sentiment of the country. None has
seemed so invariably to realize that a public wrong is a public danger, that
injustice to the humblest and weakest is peril to the well-being of all. Others
have seemed to regard the recent developments of disunion and treason
with surprise and alarm: he has esteemed them the bitter, but natural, fruit
of the deadly tree we have so long been watering and cherishing. The profound,
yet simple truth, that ‘<span class="smcap">Righteousness</span> exalteth a nation,’&mdash;that
nothing else is so baleful as injustice,&mdash;that the country which gains a large
accession of territory or of wealth at the cost of violating the least tittle of
the canons of eternal rectitude has therein made a ruinous mistake,&mdash;that
nothing else can be so important or so profitable as stern uprightness:
such is the key-note of his lofty and beneficent career. May it be vouchsafed
him to announce from his seat in the Senate the final overthrow of the
demon he has so faithfully, so nobly resisted, and that from Greenland to
Panama, from the St. John to the Pacific, the sun in his daily course looks
down on no master and no slave!”</p>

</div>

<p>A single incident will illustrate the interest excited throughout the
Commonwealth. A venerable citizen of New Bedford, seventy-nine
years of age and very feeble, was assisted to the polls, saying, “Here
goes a dying vote for Charles Sumner!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<p>The triumphant result of the election was known at once. It was
declared officially on the meeting of the Legislature.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>January 15, 1863, at twelve o’clock, each branch of the Legislature
proceeded, by special assignment, to vote for a Senator to represent
Massachusetts for six years from March 4th next ensuing. The vote
in each branch was <i>vivâ voce</i>, the roll bring called and each member
pronouncing the name of the candidate he voted for.</p>

<p>In the House there were slight manifestations of applause when the
result was announced, but they were promptly checked by the Speaker.</p>

<p>The result was noticed by the press throughout the country. The
venerable <i>National Intelligencer</i>, at Washington, which had been opposed
to the principles and policies of Mr. Sumner, employed the following
generous terms.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This is the third time that this gentleman has been thus honored by the
Legislature of Massachusetts. Such repeated tokens of confidence would
seem sufficiently to indicate, that, whatever dissent from the views of Mr.
Sumner may elsewhere exist, he is the favorite, as he is admitted by all to
be the able, representative of the opinions entertained by a majority of the
people of this great and influential State. And these views now predominate
in the conduct of the present Administration, which may be said to have
adopted, reluctantly and at a late day, the political and military policy early
commended to its favor by Mr. Sumner.</p>

<p>“If we are not able to concur with Mr. Sumner in certain of his opinions
on questions of domestic politics, it gives us only the greater pleasure to
bear our cheerful and candid testimony to the enlightened judgment and
peculiar qualifications he brings to the discharge of the important duties
devolved on him as Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations in the
Senate. In this capacity he has deservedly won the confidence of the whole
country.”</p>

</div>

<p>Such testimony from a political opponent attested the change that
had occurred in public policy and private feeling.</p>

<p>The <i>Tribune</i> exhibited the change in yet str<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>onger light.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“By a vote of nearly six to one, Massachusetts again declares her confidence
in her long-tried Senator, and, on an issue defined with unmistakable
clearness, for the third time returns him to his seat.</p>

<p>“The contrast between his present position and that which he held on first
entering the Senate is instructive. Then an arrogant Democratic majority
with unequalled effrontery declared him outside of any healthy political organization,
excluded him from the Committees, denied him parliamentary
courtesies, and withheld the common civilities of social intercourse and acquaintance.
There were hardly three or four Senators in Congress who
were in any degree identified with his opinions. He declared them none the
less boldly, and his speeches for the repeal of the Fugitive Slave Act, on
the Nebraska Bill, and on the Crime against Kansas finally exasperated the
slaveholding oligarchy into personal violence, and for words spoken in orderly
debate he was brutally assaulted on the floor of the Senate and seriously
injured. This outrage, and the enthusiastic approval with which it was
received throughout the South, were largely instrumental in rousing the
North to a right estimate of the system and the political power which sought
such means of defence.”</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>Liberator</i>, by the pen of its faithful and able editor, William
Lloyd Garrison, gave expression to the sentiments of those most enlisted
against Slavery.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Thus has Massachusetts nobly vindicated her name and fame as the
foremost State of all the world in the cause of free institutions, and trampled
beneath her feet the malignant aspersions cast upon the political reputation
of her gifted Senator by the minions of a traitorous Slave Oligarchy.
The vote is an overwhelming one, notwithstanding the desperate efforts of
Mr. Sumner’s enemies to make his defeat a sure event. Such enemies only
serve to prove his personal worth and public usefulness, and their factious
and profligate character.</p>

<p>“Mr. Sumner’s friends in Washington proposed, last week, to give him a
serenade in honor of his reëlection to the Senate; but, hearing of their intention,
he declared that the compliment was not in accordance with the present
condition of public affairs, and intimated that he preferred that the funds
subscribed for the music should be donated to the Massachusetts Soldiers’
Relief Association, which was done.”</p>

</div>

<p>In Mr. Sumner’s reëlection the cause of Emancipation triumphed,
and Massachusetts was fixed irrevocably on that side.</p>

<p>At the dinner which followed the cattle-show, Mr. Sumner was introduced
by Hon. Erastus Hopkins, who commenced by alluding to
their early days at the Boston Latin School.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;It is now full forty years, when at school I had a schoolmate
and a classmate who in point of physical altitude and breadth, but
more especially (I am no flatterer, I only speak historic truth) in point of
diligence and scholarship, was <i>primus inter pares</i>,&mdash;first among equals.
That boy was father of the man. He now holds the position of Senator in
the Senate of the United States, with a relative eminence no less than that
of his earlier days. He is the valued servant and the honored Senator of
Massachusetts, whom she has hitherto delighted to honor, and whom, so
long as she remains true to her cherished sentiments, to her gushing instincts,
and to her memorable history, <span class="smcap">she will ever honor</span>. [<i>Loud applause.</i>]</p>

<p>“We were told yesterday by the Rev. Dr. Huntington, in his admirable
address delivered in this hall, that the farmer owed his first duty to his
land,&mdash;to care for it, to fertilize it, and to beautify it. Recurring to this
point, at the close of his address, he reminded the farmer that ‘duty to his
land’ was susceptible of a double meaning: the one referring to the few
acres of his own individual and exclusive proprietorship; the other, to that
great land, that vast country, which he owned, and to which he owed duty,
in common with all his fellow-citizens.</p>

<p>“I do not know that the honorable Senator owns, or ever did own, in separate
proprietorship, any acres of land,&mdash;that he ever held the plough, or
‘drove the team a-field’; I do not know whether he intends to enlighten us
with regard to the care and culture of our homesteads and our farms; but I
do know that he understands the farmer’s ‘duty to his land,’ in the secondary
and higher sense to which allusion has been made,&mdash;that, looking over our
wide country, our rich heritage, and heritage of our fathers, he has been
ever diligent and untiring in his endeavors to remove its deformities, to augment
its fertility, and to crown it with beauty.</p>

<p>“To which department of farming the Senator will direct his remarks I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>know not; but, whatever his topic, I submit without fear his words of instruction
and of eloquence to the ordeal of your verdict.</p>

<p>“I have the honor to introduce to you the Hon. <span class="smcap">Charles Sumner</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Sumner spoke as follows.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Mr. President, Ladies, and Gentlemen</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="dropcap">I cannot forget the first time that I looked upon
this beautiful valley, where river, meadow, and hill
contribute to the charm. It was while a youth in college.
With several of my classmates I made a pedestrian
excursion through Massachusetts. Starting from Cambridge,
we passed, by way of Sterling and Barre, to Amherst,
where, arriving weary and footsore, we refreshed
ourselves at the evening prayer in the College Chapel.
From Amherst we walked to Northampton, and then, ascending
Mount Holyoke, saw the valley of the Connecticut
spread out before us, with river of silver winding
through meadows of gold. It was a scene of enchantment,
and time has not weakened the impression it
made. From Northampton we walked to Deerfield,
sleeping near Bloody Brook, and then to Greenfield,
where we turned off by Coleraine through dark woods
and over hills to Bennington in Vermont. The whole
excursion was deeply interesting, but no part more so
than your valley. Since then I have been a traveller
at home and abroad, but I know no similar scene of
greater beauty. I have seen the meadows of Lombardy,
and those historic rivers, the Rhine and the Arno, and
that stream of Charente, which Henry the Fourth called
the most beautiful of France,&mdash;also those Scottish rivers
so famous in legend and song, and the exquisite fields
and sparkling waters of Lower Austria; but my youthful
joy in the landscape which I witnessed from the
neighboring hill-top has never been surpassed in any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
kindred scene. Other places are richer in the associations
of history; but you have enough already in
what Nature has done, without waiting for any further
illustration.</p>

<p>It is a saying of Antiquity, often quoted: “Oh, too
fortunate husbandmen, if they only knew their blessings!”<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>
Nowhere are these words more applicable than
to this neighborhood, where Nature has done so much,
and where all that Nature has done is enhanced by an
intelligent and liberal spirit. An eminent French writer,
one of the greatest of his country, who wrote in the
middle of the last century, when France was a despotism,
Montesquieu, has remarked in his “Spirit of Laws,”
that “countries are not cultivated in proportion to their
fertility, but in proportion to their liberty.”<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> A beautiful
truth. But here in this valley are both. Where is
there greater fertility? where is there truer liberty?</p>

<p>If the farmers of our country needed anything to
stimulate pride in their vocation, it would be found in
the statistics furnished by the national census. That
of 1860 is not yet prepared, and I go back to that of
1850. Here it appears, that, out of the whole employed
population of the United States over fifteen
years of age, two millions four hundred thousand, or
forty-four per cent, were engaged in agricultural pursuits,
while the total number engaged in commerce,
trade, manufactures, mechanic arts, and mining was
only one million six hundred thousand, or about thirty
per cent. These figures show an immense predominance
of the agricultural interest in the whole country. Of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
course in Massachusetts the commercial and manufacturing
interests are relatively larger than in other parts
of the country. But our farmers are numerous.</p>

<p>This same census shows, that, in 1850, the four largest
staples of our country, ranking them according to their
nominal value, were: Indian corn, two hundred and
ninety-six million dollars; wheat, one hundred million
dollars; cotton, ninety-eight million dollars; hay,
ninety-six million dollars. These figures, of course, are
familiar, but they are so instructive that they will bear
repetition. Besides illustrating the magnitude of our
agricultural interests, they shed new light on the lofty
pretensions that have been made for King Cotton.
There is no crown for hay, or wheat, or Indian corn,
and yet two of these stand above cotton. But the
whole table testifies to the power of the farmer.</p>

<p>From another quarter are statistics showing how agricultural
pursuits favor longevity. Out of seventeen
hundred persons, the average life of farmers was forty-five
years; of merchants, thirty-three years; of mechanics,
twenty-nine years; and of laborers, twenty-seven
years. Thus length of days seems to be an agricultural
product.</p>

<p>Gratifying as it may be to glance at agriculture in
these statistics, which must arouse the pride, if not the
content of the farmer, there are other aspects which to
my mind are more interesting. In early days agriculture
was only an art, most imperfectly developed.
The plough of the ancient husbandman was little more
than a pole with a stick at the end by which the earth
was scratched, and other implements were of like simplicity.
As for the knowledge employed, it was all of
the most superficial character. But agriculture is now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
not only an art, in a high degree of perfection, it is
also a science, with its laws and rules, as much as navigation
or astronomy. There is no knowledge which
will not help the farmer; especially is there no branch
of science. Geography, geology, meteorology, botany,
chemistry, zoölogy, and animal physiology, all contribute.
Regarding agriculture in this light, we cannot fail
to give the farmer a high standard of excellence. In
the cultivation of the earth he practises an art and pursues
a science. But human character is elevated by the
standard which is followed.</p>

<p>There is another feature in the life of the farmer
which is to me more interesting still. The farmer is
patriotic and liberal. Dependent upon Nature, he learns
to be independent of Man. If not less than others under
the influence of local prejudices, he is at least removed
from those combinations engendered by the
spirit of trade. He thinks for himself, and acts for
his country. I do not venture to say that he is naturally
a reformer, but I think the experience of our
country attests that he does not set himself against the
ideas of the age.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Here Mr. Sumner dwelt on that spirit of obstructiveness which is so
common, illustrating it by historic instances, and then proceeded.</p>

</div>

<p>I rejoice to believe that there is no such hide-bound
indifference to liberal ideas among our farmers. But,
just in proportion as these are numerous, intelligent,
powerful, and liberal, do they constitute an arm of
strength. Pardon me, if now more than ever I see
them in this character. In appealing to them for the
sake of our country, I make no appeal inconsistent with
the proprieties of this occasion. Our country is in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>peril,
and it must be saved. This is enough.</p>

<p>Under God, our country will be saved through the
united energy, the well-compacted vigor of the people
directed by the President of the United States. Our
first duty is to stand by the President, and to hold up
his hands. There must be no hesitation or timidity.
If he calls for troops, he must have them. If, besides
calling for troops, he enlist other agencies for the suppression
of the Rebellion, he must be sustained precisely
as in calling for troops.</p>

<p>Thus far the main dependence has been troops, to
which our honored Commonwealth has made generous
contributions. No part of the country has suffered more
in gallant officers, youthful, gentle, and excellent in all
things. This neighborhood has its story of sorrow. Amherst
has buried the pure and patriotic Stearns, and only
within a few days here in Northampton you have received
from the field of death the brave and accomplished
Baker.</p>

<p>And now at last a new power is invoked, being nothing
less than that great Proclamation of the President
which places Liberty at the head of our columns.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Sumner here explained the immediate and prospective effects
of the Proclamation, and then closed as follows.</p>

</div>

<p>It is sometimes said that this edict is unconstitutional.
Some there are with whom the Constitution is a constant
stumbling-block, wherever anything is to be done
for Freedom. It cannot be so, I trust, with the liberal
farmers of this valley. Of course, the Edict of Emancipation
is to be regarded as a war measure, made in the
exercise of the Rights of War. It is as much a war
measure as the proclamation calling forth troop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>s, and is
entitled to the same support. It is not a measure of
Abolition or Antislavery, or of philanthropy, but a war
measure, pure and simple. If there be any person disposed
to discourage it, I warn him that <em>he departs from
the duties of patriotism hardly less than if he discouraged
enlistments</em>. There is but one course now before us. The
policy of Emancipation, at last adopted as a war measure,
must be sustained precisely as we sustain an army
in the field. With this new and mighty agency I cannot
doubt the result. The Rebellion will be crushed,
and the Republic will be elevated to heights of power
and grandeur where it will be an example to mankind.
It is related of the Emperor Julian, known as the Apostate,&mdash;for
he had once embraced Christianity,&mdash;that,
perishing before he had struck the last blows prepared
by hatred to the Church, he looked at the blood which
spurted from his side, and then cried, “Galilean, thou
hast conquered!” Whether fable or truth, the story
has its meaning. Such a cry will yet be heard from
the apostate chiefs in our Rebel States, “Liberty, thou
hast conquered!”&mdash;and the echo of this cry will be
heard round the globe.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Following the usage of your festival, I offer the following
sentiment:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><em>The Valley of the Connecticut.</em> Happy in its fertility, and
also in its beauty; happier still in that inspiration of Liberty
which is better than fertility or beauty.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>In the Senate, January 19th, Mr. McDougall, a Democratic Senator
from California, introduced the following resolutions, setting forth the
duty of the United States to take steps against French interference in
Mexico.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Resolved by the Senate</i> (<i>the House of Representatives concurring</i>), That
the present attempt by the Government of France to subject the Republic of
Mexico to her authority by armed force is a violation of the established and
known rules of International Law, and that it is, moreover, a violation of
the faith of France, pledged by the treaty made at London on the 31st day
of October, 1861, between the allied Governments of Spain, France, and
England, communicated to this Government over the signatures of the representatives
of the allies, by letter of the 30th day of November, 1861, and
particularly and repeatedly assured to this Government through its minister
resident at the Court of France.</p>

<p>“<i>Resolved further</i>, That the attempt to subject the Republic of Mexico
to French authority is an act not merely unfriendly to this Republic, but to
free institutions everywhere; and that it is regarded by this Republic as not
only unfriendly, but as hostile.</p>

<p>“<i>Resolved further</i>, That it is the duty of this Republic to require of the
Government of France that her armed forces be withdrawn from the territories
of Mexico.</p>

<p>“<i>Resolved further</i>, That it is the duty and proper office of this Republic,
now and at all times, to lend such aid to the Republic of Mexico as is or
may be required to prevent the forcible interposition of any of the States of
Europe in the political affairs of that Republic.</p>

<p>“<i>Resolved further</i>, That the President of the United States be requested
to cause to be communicated to the Government of Mexico the views now
expressed by the two Houses of Congress, and be further requested to cause
to be negotiated such treaty or treaties between the two Republics as will
best tend to make these views effective.”</p>

</div>

<p>February 3d, Mr. McDougall moved to take them up for consideration.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>His motion was opposed by Mr. Sumner, who said, among
other things:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">But, Sir, if the Senate had abundant time, like a
mere debating society, and were free to select at
will a topic for discussion, I surely should object at this
moment to a debate which must be not only useless, but
worse than useless. I forbear from details at present.
I wish to avoid them, unless rendered necessary. I content
myself with saying that the resolutions either mean
something or they mean nothing. If they mean nothing,
surely the Senate will not enter upon their discussion.
If they mean anything, if they are not mere words,
they mean war, and this no common war, but war with
a great and adventurous nation, powerful in fleets and
armies, bound to us by treaties and manifold traditions,
and still constant in professions of amity and good-will.
Sir, have we not war enough already on our hands, without
needlessly and wantonly provoking another? For
myself, I give all that I have of intellectual action, and
will, and heart, to the suppression of this Rebellion;
and never, by my consent, shall the Senate enter upon
a discussion the first effect of which will be aid and
comfort to the Rebellion itself.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. McDougall, in reply, said: “I trust the Senate will dare to
look the grave question of our foreign relations with France and Mexico
fairly, boldly, and openly in the face. I hope the Senate will not
take counsel of its fears.” Mr. Sumner followed.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;I, too, hope that the Senate will
dare do everything that is right; but I hope that it will
not dare to embarrass the Government at this moment,
and give aid and comfort to the Rebellion. I do not say
that the Senator means to give such aid and comfort,
but I do say that the very speech which has just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
fallen from him, to the extent of its influence, will give
aid and comfort. Can any Senator doubt that all who
sympathize with the Rebellion will rejoice to see this
Senate discussing the question of peace and war with a
great European power? Can any one doubt that the
Rebels over the way will rejoice and clap their hands,
when they hear the tidings? Sir, I will not give them
any such encouragement. They shall not have it, if vote
or voice of mine can prevent. I, too, Sir, am for the
freest latitude of debate, but I am for the suppression of
the Rebellion above and before everything else; and
the desires of the Senate must all yield at this moment
to the patriotic requirements of the country. There is
a time for all things. There is a time to weep, and
there is a time to laugh. I do not know, that, in the
chapter of national calamities, there may not be a time
for further war; but I do say that the duty of statesmanship
here in this Chamber is to set the foot down
at once against any such proposition, which, just to the
extent of its recognition, must add to present embarrassments.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The resolutions were taken up for consideration by a vote of 29 yeas
to 16 nays, when Mr. McDougall made an elaborate speech. Mr. Sumner
followed.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;At the present moment there is
one touchstone to which I am disposed to bring every
question, especially in our foreign relations; and this
touchstone is its influence on the suppression of the
Rebellion. A measure may in itself be just or expedient;
but if it would be a present burden, if it would
add to our embarrassments and troubles, and especially
if it would aggravate our military condition, th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>en, whatever
may be its merits, I am against it. To the suppression
of the Rebellion the country offers life and
treasure without stint, and it expects that these energies
shall not be sacrificed or impaired by the assumption
of any added responsibilities.</p>

<p>If I bring these resolutions to this touchstone, they
fail. They may be right or wrong in fact and principle,
but their influence at this moment, if adopted, must be
most prejudicial to the cause of the Union. Assuming
the tone of friendship to Mexico, they practically give
to the Rebellion a most powerful ally, for they openly
challenge war with France. There is madness in the
proposition. I do not question the motives of the Senator,
but it would be difficult to conceive anything more
calculated to aid and comfort the Rebellion, just in proportion
to its adoption. Sufficient unto the day is the
evil thereof. The present war is surely enough, without
adding war with France.</p>

<p>I content myself with this protest, without following
the Senator in a discussion which must be unprofitable,
if not pernicious.</p>

<p>I say nothing of France, whose power cannot be doubted,
and whose friendship I would carefully cultivate.</p>

<p>I say nothing of Mexico, our unhappy neighbor Republic,
torn, as we now are, except to declare sympathy
and cordial good-will.</p>

<p>It is sufficient that the policy of the Senator from
California, without any certainty of good to Mexico,
must excite the hostility of France, and give to the
Rebellion armies and fleets, not to mention that recognition
and foreign intervention which we deprecate.</p>

<p>Let us all unite to put down the Rebellion. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>This is
enough for the present.</p>

<p>If Senators are sensitive, when they see European
monarchies again setting foot on this hemisphere,&mdash;entering
Mexico with their armies, entering New Grenada
with their influence, and occupying the ancient
San Domingo,&mdash;let them consider that there is but one
way in which this return of empire can be arrested. It
is by the suppression of the Rebellion. Let the Rebellion
be overcome, and this whole continent will fall naturally,
peacefully, and tranquilly under the irresistible
influence of American institutions. Resolutions cannot
do this, nor speeches. I therefore move that the resolutions
lie on the table.</p>

<p>As early as May 26, 1862, Mr. Sumner introduced a resolution declaring
that the time had come for the Government “to invite all, without
distinction of color, to make their loyalty manifest by ceasing to
fight or labor for the Rebels, and also by rendering every assistance
in their power to the cause of the Constitution and the Union, according
to their ability, whether by <em>arms</em>, or labor, or information, or in
any other way.”</p>

<p>After much debate, an Act was passed to amend the Act to provide
for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the Union, suppress
insurrections, and repel invasions, approved February 28, 1795. The

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Speech in the Senate, on the Bill providing Aid for Emancipation
in Missouri, February 12, 1863.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>The recommendation of President Lincoln to aid the States in Emancipation,
though urged by him, never found great favor in Congress.
Among the measures prompted by it was one introduced into the House
of Representatives by Mr. Noell, of Missouri, entitled, “A Bill giving
aid to the State of Missouri for the purpose of securing the abolishment
of Slavery in said State.” This provided that the Government of the
United States would, upon the passage of a good and valid Act of
Emancipation of all the slaves therein, and to be irrepealable, unless
by the consent of the United States, apply the sum of ten million dollars
in United States bonds, redeemable in thirty years from date. It
passed the House by 73 yeas against 46 nays.</p>

<p>In the Senate, this bill was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary,
which reported a substitute, when it was recommitted and
another substitute reported, by which it was provided, that, on the
adoption of a valid law by Missouri “for the <em>gradual</em> or immediate
emancipation of all the slaves therein, and the exclusion of Slavery
forever thereafter from said State,” twenty million dollars in United
States bonds should be applied “to compensate for the inconveniences
produced by such change of system,” which was to take effect “on
some day not later than the fourth day of July, 1876”; but the
bonds were not to exceed ten million dollars, unless there was “full
and perfect manumission” before the fourth day of July, 1865, nor in
their aggregate were they to exceed “the sum of three hundred dollars
for each slave emancipated.”</p>

<p>This recognition of the principle of <em>Gradual</em> Emancipation, especially
as a war measure, was very disagreeable to Mr. Sumner. February 7th,
he moved to strike out “seventy-six” and insert “sixty-four,” so that
the Act of Emancipation should go into operation on the 4th of July,
1864; and here he remarked:&mdash;</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;This bill, as I understand it, is a
bill of peace; it is to bring back tranquillity in a disturbed
State. If you ask for authority under the Constitution,
I cannot doubt that it is in the War Power.
It is in the power to suppress this insurrection, to put
down this rebellion. But most strangely do you seek
to put down this rebellion by the abolition of Slavery
twenty years, or even ten years, from now. To my mind
the proposition is simply ridiculous. I use strong language,
because so it seems to me, and I cannot help
saying it.</p>

<p>Sir, for the sake of our common country at this critical
moment, for the sake of Missouri herself, for the sake
of every slave-master in Missouri, and for the sake of
every slave, I insist that Abolition shall be completed
at the nearest possible day. History, reason, and common
sense are uniform in this requirement, and I challenge
contradiction to their concurring testimony.</p>

<p>The measure on its face is double, being in the alternative.
It provides a certain sum in the event of Emancipation
taking place within two years, and another sum
if it takes place at a certain distant day. Now, Sir, I
do not desire any alternative. I trust that what we do
will take effect at once. I wish to see the benefit of it,
especially to see it felt in the suppression of the Rebellion.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Willey, of West Virginia, said, that, in his estimation, “it would
be much better for Missouri, and for the slave, if, instead of 1876, it
was 1900”; and he was followed by Mr. Henderson, of Missouri, on the
same side. Mr. Sumner replied briefly.</p>

</div>

<p>I assume that Senators are in earnest for something
to put down the Rebellion. Our country, I know, is
rich in resources. It can vote millions for almost any
purpose; but still I doubt if the Senator from Mis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>souri
would urge Congress, at this moment, to appropriate
millions, unless he expected in this way to do something
very positive against the Rebellion. I assume that this
is his object, and also the object of other Senators urging
this measure. Is there any other object to justify,
at this moment, a vote for it? Is there any Senator
who will toss twenty or ten millions of money to any
State, unless he is satisfied that by doing so he can
help put an end to the Rebellion? On this point all
must agree. Therefore do I insist on the single question,
How shall we most surely help put an end to the
Rebellion? If this can be best accomplished by immediate
Emancipation, then must we vote accordingly. But
if it is better to allow Emancipation to drag through
twenty or even ten years, with the possibility of reaction,
and with the certainty of controversy during all
this period, and, above all, without any immediate good,
then will Senators vote accordingly. Sir, I am against
any such thing. I wish the measure to be effective for
the object proposed, and, as I do not believe it can be
effective, unless immediate, I must vote accordingly.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The amendment of Mr. Sumner was lost,&mdash;Yeas 11, Nays 26.</p>

<p>In the debate which ensued, Mr. Powell, of Kentucky, taunted Mr.
Sumner with desiring the negroes of Missouri to be “freed quickly, so
that Governor Andrew can recruit there to fill up the Massachusetts
quota.” Mr. Sumner replied: “I would have a musket put in the
hands of every one of these negroes in Missouri.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner moved to amend by striking out “three hundred” and
inserting “two hundred” dollars, as the measure of value of a slave.
Here he said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>I object to the enormous valuation. I object to it
in the present bill, and also as a precedent. We shall
be bound by it hereafter. The next bill will have <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>this
same value of three hundred dollars for each slave. I
would begin by putting it at two hundred dollars, and
that is my motion.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>This amendment was adopted,&mdash;Yeas 19, Nays 17.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner then moved to strike out the word “gradual,” so that
the money should be paid only on immediate Emancipation. Here he
remarked, that he did not understand a war measure which was to go
into effect ten years from now,&mdash;that he did not understand a gradual
war measure,&mdash;that it was an absurdity in terms, and utterly indefensible.</p>

<p>The motion was lost,&mdash;Yeas 11, Nays 27.</p>

<p>The question then recurred on the adoption of the substitute, when
Mr. Sumner spoke as follows.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;If I speak tardily in this
debate, I hope for the indulgence of the Senate.
Had I been able to speak earlier, I should have spoken;
but, though present in the Chamber, and voting when
this bill was under consideration formerly, I was at the
time too much of an invalid to take an active part in
the debate. In justice to myself and to the great question,
I cannot be silent.</p>

<p>I have already voted to give Missouri twenty million
dollars to secure freedom at once for her slaves, and to
make her at once a Free State. I am ready to vote
more, if more be needed for this good purpose; but I
will not vote money to be sunk and lost in an uncertain
scheme of Prospective Emancipation, where Freedom is
a jack-o’-lantern, and the only certainty is the Congressional
appropriation. For money paid down, Freedom
must be delivered.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all differences of opinion on this
important question, there is much occasion for congratulation
in the progress made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<p>Thank God, on one point the Senate is substantially
united. A large majority will vote for Emancipation.
This is much, both as a sign of the present and a prophecy
of the future. A large majority, in the name of
Congress, will offer pecuniary aid. This is a further
sign and prophecy. Such a vote, and such an appropriation,
will constitute an epoch. Only a few short years
ago the very mention of Slavery in Congress was forbidden,
and all discussion of it was stifled. Now Emancipation
is an accepted watchword, while Slavery is
openly denounced as a guilty thing worthy of death.</p>

<p>It is admitted, that now, under the exigency of war,
the United States ought to coöperate with any State in
the abolition of Slavery, giving it pecuniary aid; and
it is proposed to apply this principle practically in Missouri.
It was fit that Emancipation, destined to end
the Rebellion, should begin in South Carolina, where
the Rebellion began. It is also fit that the action of
Congress in behalf of Emancipation should begin in
Missouri, which, through the faint-hearted remissness
of Congress, as late as 1820, was opened to Slavery.
Had Congress at that time firmly insisted that Missouri
should enter the Union as a Free State, the vast
appropriation now proposed would have been saved,
and, better still, this vaster civil war would have been
prevented. The whole country is now paying with
treasure and blood for that fatal surrender. Alas, that
men should forget that God is bound by no compromise,
and that, sooner or later, He will insist that justice shall
be done! There is not a dollar spent, and not a life sacrificed,
in this calamitous war, which does not plead
against any repetition of that wicked folly. Palsied be
the tongue that speaks of compromise with Sl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>avery!</p>

<p>Though, happily, compromise is no longer openly
mentioned, yet it insinuates itself in this debate. In
former times it took the shape of barefaced concession,
as in the admission of Missouri with Slavery, in the
annexion of Texas with Slavery, the waiver of the prohibition
of Slavery in the Territories, the atrocious bill
for the reënslavement of fugitives, and the opening of
Kansas to Slavery, first by the Kansas Bill, and then
by the Lecompton Constitution. In each of these cases
there was concession to Slavery which history records
with shame, and it was by this that your wicked slaveholding
conspiracy waxed confident and strong, till at
last it became ripe for war.</p>

<p>And now it is proposed, as an agency in the suppression
of the Rebellion, to make an end of Slavery. By
proclamation of the President, all slaves in certain States
and designated parts of States are declared free. Of
course this proclamation is a war measure, rendered just
and necessary by exigencies of war. As such, it is summary
and instant in operation, not prospective or procrastinating.
A proclamation of Prospective Emancipation
would have been an absurdity,&mdash;like a proclamation
of a prospective battle, where not a blow was to be
struck or a cannon pointed before 1876, unless, meanwhile,
the enemy desired it. What is done in war must
be done promptly, except, perhaps, under the policy of
defence. Gradualism is delay, and delay is the betrayal
of victory. If you would be triumphant, strike quickly,
let your blows be felt at once, without notice or premonition,
and especially without time for resistance or debate.
Time deserts all who do not appreciate its value.
Strike promptly, and time becomes your invaluable ally;
strike slowly, gradually, prospectively, and time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span> goes
over to the enemy.</p>

<p>But every argument for the instant carrying out of
the Proclamation, every consideration in favor of despatch
in war, is especially applicable to whatever is
done by Congress as a war measure. In a period of
peace Congress might fitly consider whether Emancipation
should be immediate or prospective, and we
could listen with patience to the instances adduced
by the Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. <span class="smcap">Doolittle</span>] in
favor of delay,&mdash;to the case of Pennsylvania, and to
the case of New York, where slaves were tardily admitted
to their birthright. Such arguments, though
to my judgment of little value at any time, might
then be legitimate. But now, when we are considering
how to put down the Rebellion, they are not even
legitimate. There is but one way to put down the
Rebellion, and that is <em>instant action</em>; and all that is
done, whether in the field, in the Cabinet, or in Congress,
must partake of this character. Whatever is
postponed for twenty years, or ten years, may seem
abstractly politic or wise; but it is in no sense a war
measure, nor can it contribute essentially to the suppression
of the Rebellion.</p>

<p>I think I may assume, without contradiction, that the
tender of money to Missouri for the sake of Emancipation
is a war measure, to be vindicated as such under
the Constitution of the United States. It is also an act
of justice to an oppressed race. But it is not in this unquestionable
character that it is now commended. If it
were urged on no other ground, even if every consideration
of philanthropy and of religion pleaded for it with
rarest eloquence, I fear that it would stand but little
chance in either House of Congress. Let us not disg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>uise
the truth. Except as a war measure to aid in putting
down the Rebellion, this proposition could expect
little hospitality here. Senators are ready to vote money&mdash;as
the British Parliament voted subsidies&mdash;to supply
the place of soldiers, or to remove a stronghold of
the Rebellion, all of which is done by Emancipation.
I do not overstate the case. Slavery is a stronghold,
which through Emancipation will be removed, while
every slave, if not every slave-master, becomes an ally
of the Government. Therefore Emancipation is a war
measure, and constitutional as the raising of armies or
the occupation of hostile territory.</p>

<p>In vindicating Emancipation as a war measure, we
must see that it is made under such conditions as to
exercise a present, <em>instant</em> influence. It must be immediate,
not prospective. In proposing Prospective Emancipation,
you propose a measure which can have little or
no influence on the war. Abstractly Senators may prefer
that Emancipation should be prospective rather than
immediate; but this is not the time for the exercise of
any abstract preference. Whatever is done as a war
measure must be immediate, or it will cease to have
this character, whatever you call it.</p>

<p>If I am correct in this statement,&mdash;and I do not see
how it can be questioned,&mdash;then is the appropriation
for Immediate Emancipation just and proper under the
Constitution, while that for Prospective Emancipation is
without sanction, except what it finds in the sentiments
of justice and humanity.</p>

<p>It is proposed to vote ten million dollars to promote
Emancipation ten years from now. Perhaps I am sanguine,
but I cannot doubt that before the expiration of
that period Slavery will die in Missouri under the awak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>ened
judgment of the people, even without the action
of Congress. If our resources were infinite, we might
tender this large sum by way of experiment; but with
a treasury drained to the bottom, and a debt accumulating
in fabulous proportions, I do not understand how
we can vote millions, which, in the first place, will be
of little or no service in the suppression of the Rebellion,
and, in the second place, will be simply a largess
in no way essential to the subversion of Slavery.</p>

<p>Whatever is given for Immediate Emancipation is
given for the national defence, and for the safety and
honor of the Republic. It will be a blow at the Rebellion.
Whatever is given for Prospective Emancipation
will be a gratuity to slaveholders and a tribute to Slavery.
Pardon me, if I repeat what I have already said
on this question: “Millions for defence, but not a cent
for tribute”; millions for defence against peril, from
whatever quarter it may come, but not a cent for tribute
in any quarter,&mdash;especially not a cent for tribute
to the loathsome tyranny of Slavery.</p>

<p>I know it is sometimes said that even Prospective
Emancipation will help weaken the Rebellion. That it
will impair the confidence in Slavery, and also its value,
I cannot doubt. But it is equally clear that it will
leave Slavery still alive and on its legs; and just so
long as this is the case, there must be controversy and
debate, with attending weakness, while Reaction perpetually
lifts its crest. Instead of tranquillity, which we
all seek for Missouri, we shall have contention. Instead
of peace, we shall have prolonged war. Every year’s
delay, ay, Sir, every week’s delay, in dealing death to
Slavery leaves just so much of opportunity to the Rebellion;
for so long as Slavery is allowed to exist in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
Missouri the Rebellion will still struggle, not without
hope, for its ancient mastery. But let Slavery cease at
once and all will be changed. There will be no room
for controversy or debate, with attending weakness; nor
can Reaction lift its crest. There will be no opportunity
to the Rebellion, which must cease all effort there,
when Missouri can no longer be a Slave State. Freedom
will become our watchful, generous, and invincible ally,
while the well-being, the happiness, the repose, and the
renown of Missouri will be established forever.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thus far, Sir, I have presented the argument on
grounds peculiar to this case; and here I might stop.
Having shown, that, as a military necessity, and for the
sake of that economy which it is our duty to cultivate,
Emancipation must be immediate, I need not go further.
But I do not content myself here. The whole question
is opened between Immediate Emancipation and
Prospective Emancipation,&mdash;or, in other words, between
doing right at once and doing right at some future, distant
day. Procrastination is the thief, not only of time,
but of virtue itself. Yet such is the nature of man that
he is disposed always to delay, so that he does nothing
to-day which he can put off till to-morrow. Perhaps in
no single matter is this disposition more apparent than
with regard to Slavery. Every consideration of humanity,
justice, religion, reason, common sense, and history,
all demanded the instant cessation of an intolerable
wrong, without procrastination or delay. But human
nature would not yield, and we have been driven to argue
the question, whether an outrage, asserting property
in man, denying the conjugal relation, annulling the parental
relation, shutting out human improvement, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
robbing its victim of all the fruits of his industry,&mdash;the
whole to compel work without wages,&mdash;should be
stopped instantly or gradually. It is only when we
regard Slavery in its essential elements, and look at
its unutterable and unquestionable atrocity, that we
fully comprehend the mingled folly and wickedness of
this question. If it were merely a question of economy,
or a question of policy, then the Senate might properly
debate whether the change should be instant or gradual;
but considerations of economy and policy are all absorbed
in the higher claims of justice and humanity. There is
no question whether justice and humanity shall be immediate
or gradual. Men are to cease at once from
wrong; they are to obey the Ten Commandments instantly,
and not gradually.</p>

<p>Senators who argue for Prospective Emancipation show
themselves insensible to the true character of Slavery,
or insensible to the requirements of reason. One or the
other of these alternatives must be accepted.</p>

<p>Shall property in man be disowned immediately, or
only prospectively? Reason answers, Immediately.</p>

<p>Shall the conjugal relation be maintained immediately,
or only prospectively? Reason recoils from the
wicked absurdity of the inquiry.</p>

<p>Shall the parental relation be recognized immediately,
or only prospectively? Reason is indignant at the
question.</p>

<p>Shall the opportunities of knowledge, including the
right to read the Book of Life, be opened immediately
or prospectively? Reason brands the idea of delay as
impious.</p>

<p>Shall th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>e fruits of his own industry be given to a fellow-man
immediately or prospectively? Reason insists
that every man shall have his own without postponement.</p>

<p>And history, thank God, speaking by examples, testifies
in conformity with reason. The conclusion is irresistible.
If you would contribute to the strength and
honor of the Nation, if you would bless Missouri, if you
would benefit the slave-master, if you would elevate the
slave, and, still further, if you would afford an example
which shall fortify and consecrate the Republic, making
it at once citadel and temple, do not put off the day of
Freedom. In this case, more than in any other, he gives
twice who quickly gives.</p>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Speeches in the Senate, on the Bill To authorize the President,
in all Domestic or Foreign Wars, to issue Letters of
Marque and Reprisal, February 14 and 17, 1863.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>At the close of the preceding session of Congress, Mr. Grimes introduced
a bill concerning Letters of Marque and Reprisal, but he was
unable to secure the action of the Senate upon it. January 7, 1863,
he again asked for its consideration, when, on motion of Mr. Sumner,
it was referred to the Committee on Naval Affairs. January 20th, it
was reported from the Committee by Mr. Hale, with amendments.
February 14th, Mr. Grimes moved to proceed with its consideration.
In opposing this motion, Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;It seems to me that this bill is
in all respects a misconception. There is nothing now
to justify letters of marque and reprisal; and when
Senators say that Massachusetts is interested in their
issue, I repel the suggestion. Sir, Massachusetts is interested
in putting down the Rebellion. She is also interested
in clearing the sea of pirates. Such is her open
and unquestionable interest, and to this end she is concerned
in the employment of all possible agencies consistent
with the civilization of our day. Massachusetts
is interested in the enlargement of the marine, national
and private, and I add, also, in the present enlistment
of the private marine in the national service; but this
is very different from the issue of letters of marque.</p>

<p class="center">…</p>

<p>I thin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>k the Senator from Iowa is misled by a phrase.
He speaks of the militia of the sea. It is a captivating
phrase, I admit; but the meaning is not entirely clear.
The Senator finds it in privateers,&mdash;that is, private armed
ships, belonging to private individuals, under the command
of private persons, cruising against private commerce,
and paid exclusively by booty. Such is his idea
of a sea militia. I confess this is not very captivating
to me. My idea of a sea militia is different. It is all
the ships of the country, if the occasion require, under
the national flag, in the service of the country as national
ships, with the character of national ships, enjoying
everywhere the immunities of national ships, and
free from the suspicions always attaching to the privateer,
wherever it appears. An enactment, authorizing
the employment of the mercantile marine in the national
service as part of the national navy, would be practical
and reasonable. Such a marine might justly be called
the militia of the sea; but I must protest against the
deceptive militia of the Senator.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The bill was taken up by a vote of 31 yeas and 6 nays; but, after
ordering the printing of amendments, it was postponed.</p>

<p>February 17th, it was taken up again, when Mr. Sumner spoke in
reply to Mr. Grimes.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;The Senator from Iowa [Mr.
<span class="smcap">Grimes</span>], who has just taken his seat, ingeniously
and elaborately vindicates a bill which, at least in one
feature, is an innovation upon the original policy of
our country; and, strange to say, while doing so, he
pleads for what he calls our traditional policy. I, too,
plead for our traditional policy, but not the policy of the
Senator. And I plead also for a policy which, whether
traditional or not, will provide for the national defence
according to that best economy which takes counsel of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
prudence as well as of courage.</p>

<p>The Senator, with seeming triumph, asks if we can
afford to declare that our whole private marine shall rot
at the wharf. Clearly not, and nobody proposes to declare
so, although we might as well do this as recklessly
provoke war which must drive our commerce from
the ocean,&mdash;if in no other way, by the increased rates
of insurance. I would secure for our private marine
the amplest opportunity, that it may continue without
interruption to plough every sea with its keels, and
that, wherever it appears, it may find its accustomed
welcome. The policy of the Senator has no such
promise.</p>

<p>All will concur in any practical measure at this time
for the increase of our strength on the ocean. To this
end my vote shall not be wanting. But to my mind it
is clear to demonstration that the measure proposed
is not practical in character, that it promises no result
which cannot be reached better in another way, while
it is almost sure to bring upon the country additional
embarrassment. It may be bold, but I am sure it is not
prudent, nor is there in it economy of any kind.</p>

<p>This bill is entitled, “Concerning Letters of Marque,
Prizes, and Prize Goods.” The title is borrowed from
the two statutes of 1812 and 1813. It is, in plain terms,
a bill to authorize <em>Privateers</em>,&mdash;that is, private armed
vessels licensed to cruise against the commerce of an
enemy, and looking to booty for support, compensation,
and salary. It is by booty that owners, officers, and
crews are to be paid. Booty is the motive power and
life-spring. Such is this bill on its face, without going
into detail. Surely a bill of this character ought not to
pass without strong reason.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

<p>Looking at the bill more closely, it is found to have
two distinct features: <i>first</i>, as a new agency against the
Rebellion; <i>secondly</i>, as a provision for privateers in any
future war. I regard these two features as distinct.
They may be considered separately. One may be right,
and the other wrong. One may be adopted, and the
other rejected.</p>

<p>So far as the bill promises substantial help in putting
down the Rebellion without more than countervailing
mischief, it may properly be entertained. But what can
it do against the Rebellion? And where is the policy
or necessity on which it is founded? If Senators think
that the bill can do any good now, I am sure they listen
to their hopes rather than to the evidence. Why, Sir,
the Rebels, against whom you would cruise, are absolutely
without commerce. Pirate ships they have,
equipped in England, armed to the teeth, and unleashed
upon the sea to prey upon us; but there is not a single
bottom of theirs that can afford the booty which is the
pay and incentive of the privateer. It would be hardly
more irrational to enlist private armed ships against the
King of Dahomey.</p>

<p>I know it is said that our navy is too small, and that
more ships are needed, not only for transportation, but
also to increase and strengthen the blockade, or to cruise
against pirates. Very well. Hire them, and put them
in commission as Government ships, with the immunities,
the responsibilities, and the character of such ships.
There can be no difficulty in this; and, better still,
there will be no difficulty afterwards. This is simple
and practical.</p>

<p>But, while I s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>ee no probable good from launching privateers
upon the ocean to cruise against a commerce
that does not exist, and to be paid by a booty that
cannot be found, I see certain evils which I am anxious
to avoid for the sake of my country, especially at this
moment. I think that I cannot be mistaken in this
anxiety.</p>

<p>It is well known, that, according to ancient usage and
the Law of Nations, every privateer is entitled to belligerent
rights, one of which is that most difficult, delicate,
and dangerous right, the much disputed Right of Search.
There is no Right of War with regard to which nations
are more sensitive,&mdash;and no nation has been more sensitive
than our own, while none has suffered more from
its exercise. By virtue of this right, every licensed sea-rover
is entitled on the ocean to stop and overhaul all
merchant vessels under whatever flag. If he cannot
capture, he can at least annoy. If he cannot make
prize, he can at least make trouble, and leave behind
a sting. I know not what course the great neutral powers
may adopt, nor do I see how they can undertake to
set aside this ancient right, even if they smart under its
exercise. But when I consider that these powers have
already by solemn convention&mdash;I refer, of course, to
the Congress of Paris in 1856&mdash;renounced the whole
system of privateers among themselves, I confess my
fears that they will not witness with perfect calmness
the annoyance to which their commerce will be exposed.
And now, Sir, mark my prediction. Every exercise upon
neutral commerce of this terrible Right of Search will
be the fruitful occasion of misunderstanding, bickering,
and controversy, at a moment when, if my voice could
prevail, there should be nothing to interfere with that
accord, harmony, and sympathy which are due from
civilized states to our Republic in its great battle wi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>th
Barbarism. Even if we are not encouraged to expect
these things from Europe, I hope that nothing will be
done by us to put impediments in their way. Justly
sensitive with regard to our own rights, let us respect
the sensibility of others.</p>

<p>It is not enough to say that we have an unquestioned
right to issue letters of marque. Rights, when exercised
out of season or imprudently, may be changed into
wrongs. It was a maxim of ancient jurisprudence, <i>Sic
utere tua, ut alienum non lædas</i>, and I think that this
maxim, at least in spirit, is applicable to the present
occasion. Our right may be clear; but, if its exercise
would injure or annoy others, especially without corresponding
advantage to ourselves, we shall do well, if we
forbear to exercise it.</p>

<p>Thus far I have considered that part of the bill which
provides for privateers against the Rebels; but I cannot
quit this branch of the question without calling attention
again to the scenes that must ensue, if these privateers
are let loose. Picture to yourselves the ocean
traversed by licensed rovers seeking prey. The Dutch
admiral carried a broom at his mast-head as the boastful
sign that he swept the seas. The privateer might carry
a scourge. Wherever a sail appears, there is chase; the
signal gun is fired, and the merchantman submits to
visitation and search. Delay is the least of the consequences.
Contention, irritation, humiliation ensue, all
calculated to engender ill-feeling, which, beginning with
individuals, may embrace country and government. I
do not say that such an act, even harshly exercised
upon neutral commerce, will bring upon us further
war, but I would not try the experiment. The speaking-trumpet
of a reckless privateer may contribute to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
that discord which is the herald of bloodshed itself.</p>

<p>But, Sir, even if you think it worth while to authorize
privateers against the Rebels, to cruise against an
imaginary commerce, in quest of an imaginary booty,
why not stop there? The measure would not be wise,
but it might find seeming apology in the present condition
of affairs. The bill of the Committee, and also the
amendment of the Senator from Iowa, go much further.
It is a general bill, authorizing privateers, not merely
against the Rebels, but also against foreign nations in
future wars, in the discretion of the President. I quote
from the bill of the Committee.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That, whenever war exists or has been declared between
the United States and any other nation, and during the
present Rebellion, the President of the United States is
hereby authorized to issue to private vessels of the United
States commissions or letters of marque and general reprisal,
in such form as he may think proper.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mark the language, “whenever war exists.” I am not
ready to say that these words give the President power
to declare the existence of war without the intervention
of Congress; but I object to the whole clause on account
of its generality. And the substitute of the Senator
is obnoxious to the same objection. It says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That, <em>in all domestic and foreign wars</em>, the President of
the United States is authorized to issue to private armed
vessels of the United States commissions or letters of marque
and general reprisal, in such form as he shall think proper.”</p>

</div>

<p>This is a general provision, by which the President is
authorized to issue letters of marque, not only to aid in
putting down the present Rebellion, but also “in all
domestic and foreign wars” which may occur hereafter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
I will not say that any such general, prospective provision,
although clearly a departure from that traditional
policy which the Senator professes to uphold,
is positively unconstitutional; but I am sure that it is
contrary to the spirit of the Constitution. To me it
seems obvious that the Constitution contemplated the
special action of Congress on every occasion for the
exercise of this power. This was the safeguard against
excess or blunder. Such a power was not to be exercised
hastily or inconsiderately, but with full and special
consideration. It was not to be exercised all at once
and in the lump, but as the exigency occurred in individual
cases. And Congress, which was empowered to
declare war, had the further power, in the same way and
with similar solemnities, to give the war this additional
feature, if, under the circumstances, it thought best.
This great power was not handed over indefinitely to
the President, to be wielded at will, but was lodged in
Congress. If Congress is not insensible to the spirit
of the Constitution, it will never hand it over to the
President, as now proposed.</p>

<p>Even in England, where the power to declare war is
lodged with the sovereign in council, it seems that in
point of fact letters of marque are regulated by special
Acts of Parliament on the breaking out of war. This is
stated by Chitty, in his work on the Prerogatives of the
Crown.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“By various statutes, <em>enacted during every war</em>, the Lord
High Admiral, or the Commissioners of the Admiralty, are
empowered to grant commissions, or, as they are also called,
letters of marque and reprisals, to the owners of ships, enabling
them to attack and take the property of his Majesty’s
enemies, which statutes contain, also, various provisions as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
to the prizes captured. (See 29 George II. c. 34; 19 George
III. c. 67; 43 George III. c. 160; 45 George III. c. 72.)”<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Obviously recognizing this principle, which is so entirely
consistent with reason and that wisdom which
is the strength of nations, our country thus far in its
history has declined to pass any general prospective
law authorizing letters of marque. This is our traditional
policy, which the Senator seeks to overturn. The
statute authorizing letters of marque in 1812 expired
with the war. It was not general or prospective. Is
there any reason now that we should depart from this
policy? Is there any good to be accomplished by such
departure? It is strange that at this moment, when
other nations renounce privateering, we should rush forward
and ostentatiously declare it part of our political
system,&mdash;I might almost say, an element of our political
life. Pray, if this declaration were of such importance,
why has it been so long postponed? Generations,
jealous guardians of all our national rights, have passed
away, leaving the statute-book without any such voice.
It did not occur to them that the national defence or
the national honor required it. And yet the discovery
is suddenly made that this is a mistake, or that our
predecessors were all wrong, especially in not announcing
to the world that in the event of war privateers
will be let loose.</p>

<p>As there is no foreign war in which we are now engaged,
this provision is prospective and minatory, so far
as foreign nations are concerned. It is notice to avoid
any question with us, under penalty of depredations
by privateers. If not a menace, it is very like one. I
do not know that it will be so interpreted by those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span> to
whom it is addressed, but I am sure that it can do no
good; and just in proportion as it is so interpreted, it
will be worse than useless. A menace is as ill-timed
between nations as between individuals.</p>

<p>I do not dwell now on the irrational character of
privateering, but I seize the occasion to declare my
deliberate judgment that our country may yet find, to
its cost, that this cherished weapon is a two-edged
sword. A nation with an extensive commerce cannot
afford to invite the hazard of its employment. Thus,
in the event of war with a power inferior to ourselves in
commerce, as Portugal, or Spain, or France, the increased
rates of insurance would make it impossible for us to
keep our ships afloat, while all our profits on the ocean
would be appropriated by those nations happily still at
peace. The very superiority of our commerce would
be a disadvantage, inasmuch as we should be more exposed.
For instance, in a war with Portugal or Spain
we should stake gold against copper, and even in a war
with France it would be gold against silver. If this
prospect pleases, then Senators will vote for a measure
which may be called <em>Privateering made easy; or, how
to do it without Congress</em>.</p>

<p>Nor do I discuss the immorality and brutality too
naturally engendered by a system whose inspiration is
booty. Here I content myself with the words of General
Halleck, in his excellent summary of International
Law.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“But, even with these precautions, privateering is usually
accompanied by abuses and enormous excesses. The use of
privateers, or private armed vessels under letters of marque
and reprisal, has often been discussed by publicists and text-writers
on International Law, and has recently been made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
the subject of diplomatic correspondence and negotiation between
the United States and the principal European powers.
The general opinion of text-writers is, that privateering,
though contrary to national policy and the more enlightened
spirit of the present age, is, nevertheless, allowable under
the general rules of International Law. <em>It leads to the worst
excesses and crimes, and has a most corrupting influence upon
all who engage in it</em>, but cannot be punished as a breach of
the Law of Nations. <em>The enlightened opinion of the world
is most decidedly in favor of abolishing it</em>, and recent events
lead to the hope that all the commercial nations of both
hemispheres will unite in no longer resorting, in time of
war, to so barbarous a practice.”<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

</div>

<p>There is another American authority I ought not
to omit. I refer to Chancellor Kent, who in his much
quoted Commentaries has recorded his judgment. If I
chose to cross the ocean, I might add indefinitely to
this testimony; but I confine myself to our own countrymen,
so that you shall see privateering as judged by
Americans. Here are the words of the great jurist.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“As a necessary precaution against abuse, the owners of
privateers are required, by the ordinances of the commercial
states, to give adequate security that they will conduct the
cruise according to the laws and usages of war and the instructions
of the Government, and that they will regard the
rights of neutrals, and bring their prizes in for adjudication.
These checks are essential to the character and safety of
maritime nations. <em>Privateering, under all the restrictions
which have been adopted, is very liable to abuse.</em> The object
is not fame or chivalric warfare, but plunder and profit.
The discipline of the crews is not apt to be of the highest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
order, <em>and privateers are often guilty of enormous excesses, and
become the scourge of neutral commerce</em>. They are sometimes
manned and officered by foreigners, having no permanent
connection with the country, or interest in its cause. This
was a complaint made by the United States, in 1819, in
relation to irregularities and acts of atrocity committed by
private armed vessels sailing under the flag of Buenos Ayres.
<em>Under the best regulations, the business tends strongly to blunt
the sense of private right and to nourish a lawless and fierce
spirit of rapacity.</em>”<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It is well known that these were the sentiments of
the founders of our Republic, which, in its early treaty
with Prussia, took the lead in denouncing the whole
system of privateering. Is it not better to follow this
example, until positive, irresistible exigencies of war
compel us to depart from it? If we cannot do this,
let us at least keep from affording new facilities to an
offensive system. What our country denounced in other
days should not now be proclaimed and glorified.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Grimes.</span> The Senator will allow me to inquire when
it was that this nation denounced the system of privateering.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> By the treaty of 1785.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Grimes.</span> The Prussian treaty, I suppose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> The Prussian treaty.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Grimes.</span> I should like to know the purport of that
denunciation. Was it not a mere stipulation that we should
not prey on the commerce of that nation?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> It was a stipulation to the effect, that, in
any war between the United States and Prussia, neither party
should commission privateers to depredate on the commerce
of the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Grimes.</span> A stipulation that I suppose this Government
could very easily make, because Prussia has no commerce.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I wish the treaty had been such as
to afford a stronger example; but it must be accepted
as the judgment of our country at that time; and to
my mind it is a practical denunciation of privateering,
worthy of the illustrious character by whom it was negotiated,
who was none other than Benjamin Franklin.
But this treaty is not all. I do not forget how Jefferson
wrote to France, “The benevolence of this proposition
is worthy of the nation from which it comes, and our
sentiments on it have been declared in the treaty to
which you are pleased to refer, as well as in some others
which have been proposed,”<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> thus testifying to our
treaty and to his own sentiments; and, at a later day,
that John Quincy Adams, in his instructions to Mr.
Rush, of July 28, 1823, directing him to negotiate a
treaty with Great Britain for the abolition of privateering,
declared that this was “an object which has long
been dear to the hearts and ardent in the aspirations
of the benevolent and the wise, an object essentially
congenial to the true spirit of Christianity”; and he
adopted the earlier declaration of Franklin, “It is time,
it is high time, for the sake of humanity, that a stop
were put to this enormity.”<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Grimes.</span> I am speaking now of the declaration which
the Senator has seen fit to designate as a national denunciation
of privateers, made in 1785, though the Constitution,
which was made in 1787, expressly reserved to Congress the
power to issue letters of marque and reprisal. Taking these
two facts, the treaty made in 1785 and the Constitution made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>in 1787, how can it be asserted that the ancient policy of the
Government is against privateering, and that we have nationally
denounced it?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> The Senator will pardon me, if I say
that I know no better denunciation than that of a treaty
negotiated by Franklin. A treaty is the act of the nation,
and testifies to the sentiments of the nation. If
the same denunciation did not find place in more important
treaties, it is reasonable to suppose that it was
not acceptable to the other contracting parties. It is an
historic fact, that Franklin sought to embody this denunciation
in the very treaty by which our independence
was acknowledged, and thus to associate it with our
national being.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> Indeed, it was a standing offer from
our Government to foreign powers.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> Unquestionably
the Constitution gives Congress the power to issue letters
of marque, but the reason is obvious: because privateering
was recognized at that time as a proper agency
of war. The framers of the Constitution did not divest
the government they created of a power which belonged
to other governments according to the existing usage
of nations. In recognizing this power, they express no
opinion upon its character. For that we must go to the
treaty, and to the words and efforts of Franklin, Jefferson,
and John Quincy Adams, speaking and acting officially
for the nation,&mdash;all but Franklin subsequent to
the Constitution.</p>

<p>And now, Sir, at the risk of repetition, I enumerate
my objections to this bill.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span></p>
<p>1. It proposes to cruise against a non-existent commerce,
for the sake of a non-existent booty.</p>

<p>2. It accords to private individuals the belligerent
right of search, which must be fruitful of trouble in our
relations with the great neutral powers.</p>

<p>3. It gives to the President, in his discretion, the
power to issue letters of marque in any future wars,
without any further authority of Congress, when this
power should always wait for the special authority of
Congress on the declaration of war.</p>

<p>4. It is in the nature of a menace to foreign nations,
and therefore worse than useless.</p>

<p>5. It vitalizes and legalizes a system which civilization
always accepted with reluctance, and our own
country was one of the earliest and most persistent
to denounce.</p>

<p>6. It will give us a bad name in history.</p>

<p>It does all this without accomplishing any substantial
good. If it be said that ships are needed for transportation,
or for the blockade, or in order to pursue pirates
on the sea, then, I repeat, let the Government hire them.
The way is easy, and it is also the way of peace. To
this end I offer a substitute for the present bill, which
will secure to the Government all the aid it can desire,
without the disadvantage or shame of a measure which
can be justified only by overruling necessity. I will
read the substitute.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That the Secretary of the Navy be authorized to hire
any vessels needed for the national service, and, if he sees
fit, to put them in charge of officers commissioned by the
United States, and to give them in every respect the character
of national ships.”</p>

</div>

<p>If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span> Senators desire a militia of the seas, here it is,&mdash;a
sea militia, precisely like the land militia, mustered
into the service of the United States, under the command
of the United States, and receiving rations and
pay from the United States, instead of sea-rovers, not
mustered into the national service, not under national
command, and not receiving rations or pay from the
nation, but cruising each for himself, according to his
own will, without direction, without concert, simply
according to the wild temptation of booty. Such a
system on land would be rejected at once. Nobody
would call it a militia. Do not sanction it now on
the ocean; or, if you are disposed to sanction it, call
it not a militia of the seas.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The bill was then amended, on motion of Mr. Sherman, by limiting
it to “three years from the passage of this Act.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner then moved to strike out the words “in all domestic
and foreign wars,” and to insert “to aid in putting down the present
Rebellion,” so that it would read,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That, <em>to aid in putting down the present Rebellion</em>, the President of the
United States is authorized to issue to private armed vessels of the United
States commissions,” &amp;c.</p>

</div>

<p>On this motion he remarked:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;The question is now presented precisely,
whether the Senate will confine this bill in operation
to the war in which we are actually engaged for
the suppression of the Rebellion, or make it prospective
in character, applicable to some war in the unknown
future, to some country not named, to some exigency
not now understood, and therefore, in its nature, a notice
or warning, if not a menace, to all countries.</p>

<p>This is the precise question: Shall the bill be confined
to our own time, to this day, to this hour, to something
we can see, to what is actually before us; or shall it be
extended also to the future, to something we cannot see,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
to what is not actually before us, and with regard to
which we can have no knowledge, unless we listen to
our fears?</p>

<p>If the words are introduced as a menace, then are
they out of place and irrational. Suppose any such
words in the legislation of Great Britain or France at
a moment when they might be interpreted as applicable
to us, who can doubt their injurious effect upon public
opinion here? A brave and intelligent people will not
bend before menace, nor can any such attempt affect a
well-considered national policy. All history and reason
show that such conduct is more irritating than soothing.
Sir, if you are in earnest, as I cannot doubt, to cultivate
those relations of peace and good-will with foreign nations
which are in themselves a cheap defence, you must
avoid all legislation which can be misinterpreted, especially
everything which looks like menace.</p>

<p>I cannot pretend to foresee the future. I know not
that other wars may not be in store for us, that we may
not be called to confront other powers, in alliance, perhaps,
with our Rebels, and to make still greater efforts.
All this may come; but I pray not. If it does come,
then let us meet its duties and responsibilities like Senators;
but do not rush forward recklessly, like the bully
with his bludgeon, ready to strike wherever there is a
head. I do not believe in such legislation; nor do I
believe in any legislation providing new facilities for a
war, or tending to produce irritation and distrust. Prepared
always for the future, I would not challenge it.
Preparation and provocation are widely different. Nor
would I do anything out of season. There was characteristic
wisdom in the remark of the venerable Chief
Justice of England, Sir Matthew Hale, when he said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
that “we must not jump before we get to the stile.” It
seems to me that Senators who are pressing this bill
forget this time-honored injunction, and try to make
their country take a jump prematurely.</p>

<p class="center">…</p>

<p>You have just listened to the Senator from California
[Mr. <span class="smcap">McDougall</span>], announcing that perhaps before the
next meeting of Congress there may be foreign war;
and you have not forgotten his elaborate speech only
the other day, when he openly challenged war with
France. I ask Senators, if, at this critical moment,
they are ready to follow him in his effort to carry us
in that direction. For myself, I protest against it. I
am heart and soul for putting down this Rebellion
without playing into the hands of Rebels. Now it
must be plain to all that every word calculated to draw
or drive any foreign government into alliance with the
Rebellion does play into the hands of Rebels. Senators
may be willing to distract the attention of the country
from our single object, to impair the national force, and
help surrender all to the uncertainties and horrors of
accumulating war. Let me not enter into their counsels.
It is not my habit to shrink from responsibility;
personal risks I accept willingly; but I confess anxiety
that my country should not rush abroad in quest of new
dangers, whose only effect will be to increase the national
calamities.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The amendment of Mr. Sumner was lost,&mdash;Yeas 13, Nays 22.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner then moved to strike out the words authorizing the
President to “make all needful rules and regulations,” and to insert&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The provisions of the Act of Congress, approved on the 26th day of
Ju<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>ne, 1812, entitled ‘An Act concerning letters of marque, prizes, and prize
goods,’ and of the Act of Congress, approved on the 27th day of January,
1813, entitled ‘An Act in addition to the Act concerning letters of marque,
prizes, and prize goods,’ are hereby revived, and shall be in force in relation
to all that part of the United States where the inhabitants have been
declared in a state of insurrection, and the vessels and property to them
belonging.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Sumner explained the amendment.</p>

</div>

<p>It will be observed, that, by the amendment already
adopted, the President alone, without the coöperation
of Congress, is empowered to make what are called all
needful rules and regulations for the government and
conduct of these privateers, and for the adjudication and
disposal of prizes and salvages made by them. But
formerly it was not so ordered. No such large power
was ever before vested in the President. By the statute
of June 26, 1812, a system was provided, in seventeen
sections, for the government of letters of marque,
prizes, and prize goods. These sections relate to the
formalities required from persons applying for letters
of marque, the bonds to be given, and the sureties, how
the captured property shall be forfeited, the distribution
of the prize money, the distribution of salvage, how the
prize shall be brought in for adjudication, regulations
concerning prisoners found on board of prize vessels,
instructions for the privateers, bounty for destroying
the enemy’s vessels, instructions to the commanding
officers of privateers to keep journals, how owners of
privateers are punishable for violating the revenue laws
of the United States, how offences on board private
armed vessels are punishable; also the commissions of
collectors and consuls upon prize goods, and the uses
to which they shall be applied. Here is a statute, in
itself a code, containing provisions exclusively applicable
to these important matters, all determined by Congress
in advance; but it is now proposed that Congress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
shall abdicate, leaving to the President alone this large
power.</p>

<p>I call attention to one matter in the statute, namely,
“How offences on board private armed vessels shall be
punished.” It is enacted, “that all offences committed
by any officer or seaman on board any such vessel having
letters of marque and reprisal, during the present
hostilities against Great Britain, shall be tried and punished
in such manner as the like offences are or may
be tried and punished, when committed by any person
belonging to the public ships of war of the United
States.”<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>I would ask if it is in the power of the President
merely by regulation to determine how offences on
board private armed vessels shall be tried and punished?
I take it that Congress must deal directly with
this question. I am sure that it is unwise for Congress
to renounce a duty belonging to it obviously under the
Constitution, and which in former times it exercised.
Senators sometimes complain that great powers are assumed
by the President; but, unless I misread this bill,
they are about to confer on him powers large, indeed,
beyond precedent. There is, in the first place, the power
to declare whether, in case of war with a foreign nation,
letters of marque shall be issued,&mdash;a high prerogative,
in times past reserved exclusively to Congress. But, not
content with this, they would confer upon him plenary
powers, as legislator, with regard to everything to be
done by the letter of marque, and with regard, also,
to its possible prizes. As once the French monarch
exclaimed, “The State, it is I!”&mdash;so, when we have
conferred these powers, one after another, on the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>President,
I think he may make a similar exclamation.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>This amendment was also lost.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner then moved the following substitute for the pending
bill:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That the Secretary of the Navy be authorized to hire any vessels needed
for the national service, and, if he see fit, to put them in charge of officers
commissioned by the United States, and to give them in every respect the
character of national ships.”</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>The proposition on which a vote is now asked has all
that is good in the pending measure, without any of the
unquestionable disadvantages. I am unwilling to trespass
upon the Senate, and would hope that I am not too
earnest; but the question, to my mind, is of no common
character.</p>

<p>The Senator who presses this measure seeks to employ
private enterprise in all wars, domestic or foreign:
I show him how it can be done. He seeks to enlist the
private marine of the country in the public service: I
show him how it can be done. He seeks to contribute
at this moment to the national force: I show him how
it can be done. Say not that I am against the employment
of private enterprise. Nor say that I would allow
our private marine to rot at the wharf. Nor say that I
would begrudge anything needed by the national force.
To this end the Senate cannot go further than I. All
that the Senator would do I would do, but in a way to
avoid those embarrassments and difficulties necessarily
incident to privateering, and so as to be in harmony
with the civilization of our age. Nor shall it be said
that I shrink from any of the responsibilities which
belong to us with regard to foreign nations; but I
desire to say, that among the highest responsibilities
which any can recognize is that of doing nothing n<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>eedlessly
which shall add to existing troubles or give the
country a new burden.</p>

<p>In conclusion, let me once more remind you that
every privateer upon the ocean carries the right of
search. Wherever he sails, he is authorized to overhaul
neutral ships in search of contraband, or, it may
be, to determine if the voyage is to break the blockade.
A right so delicate and grave I would reserve to the
Government, to be exercised only by national ships. I
cannot err, when I insist that it shall be intrusted to
those only whose position, experience, and relations
with the Government give assurance that it will be
exercised with wisest discretion.</p>

<p>If, in order to secure private enterprise and to enlist
all its energies, it were necessary to have privateers,
then the argument of the other side might be entitled
to weight. But all that you desire can be had without
any such resort, and without any drawback or disadvantage.
Let the Secretary of the Navy hire private ships,
wherever he can find them, and put them in commission
as national ships, with the rations, pay, officers, and
character of national ships. This will be simple and
most effective. I am at a loss for any objection to it:
I can see none.</p>

<p>I may be mistaken, Sir, but I speak in frankness. To
my mind the question between the two propositions is
too clear for argument. On one side it is irrational,
barbarous, and fruitless, except of trouble. On the other
side you have practical strength, and the best assurance
of that prudence which is the safeguard of peace. Between
the two let the Senate choose.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span></p>
<div class="medium">

<p>This amendment was also lost,&mdash;Yeas 8, Nays 28.</p>

<p>The bill then passed the Senate,&mdash;Yeas 27, Nays 9. March 2d, it
passed the House of Representatives without a division, and was subsequently
approved by the President.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Failing in Congress, Mr. Sumner renewed his opposition with President
Lincoln, urging upon him the impolicy of any action under the
law. He advised most strenuously that no commissions should be issued,
and that the law should be allowed to remain a dead letter. The
President was so much impressed by these representations that he invited
Mr. Sumner to attend the next meeting of his Cabinet and make
them there. When Mr. Sumner doubted the expediency of such a step,
as possibly giving rise to comment, the President requested him to see
the members of his Cabinet individually, which he did. No commissions
were ever issued, and the attempt soon subsided.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This effort to set afloat privateers created anxiety among our friends
in England. Mr. Bright wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I hope the President will remain firm against the letters of marque, so
long as peace is preserved. They will do no good, and only tend to war. I
was sorry your fight against the bill was in vain.”</p>

</div>

<p>A letter from Mr. Bates, the intelligent American partner in the
London house of the Barings, confirmed the President in his determination.
Another letter from the same source concurs with Mr. Bright
in condemning the project.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I am very glad that anything I have written has had any effect in stopping
the issue of letters of marque, for I am convinced that their issue would
have led to a war, and would have given those who in this country wish for
war an opportunity through the press to make a war popular. It would,
further, have been playing into the hands of the Confederates, who are doing
all they can to embarrass the relations between this country and the United
States. It is the last card the Confederates have to play.”</p>

</div>

<p>The Act of Congress authorizing letters of marque has since expired
by its own limitation.</p>

<p>The Senate having under consideration the bill to regulate the appointment

following amendment:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And to be selected by the Senators, Representatives, and Delegates on
the ground of merit and qualification, to be ascertained by an examination
of the candidates, and that the Secretary of the Navy be authorized to make

with the provisions of this Act.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Sumner sustained the amendment.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Because these appointments are conferred upon
youth, or, if you please, upon boys, it seems to me
that they are too often regarded as of little moment.
In reality, they are among the most important appointments
under Government. They are appointments for
life; since, beginning with the youth or boy, they end
only at death, it may be as captain, commodore, or admiral,
supported always at the expense of the country,
and with increasing emoluments corresponding to increasing
rank.</p>

<p>Therefore do I think that the Government cannot be
too careful in securing the best youths, and I welcome
cordially the proposition of the Senator from Rhode
Island. I think it entirely practicable, and also most
important. I hope the Senate will adopt it. I cannot
doubt that such places should be given only to the mos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>t

</div>

<p>Mr. Sumner followed.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;I would not have this proposition
treated with levity. I do not say that it
has been. Suffice it for me that I make it in sincerity,
because I think the exception worthy of place in
a permanent statute regulating the military system of
our country.</p>

<p>I shall not be led into debate, but you will let me
declare my conviction that the proper duty of the clergyman,
if he joins the army, is as chaplain, ministering
to the sick, the wounded, the dying, and teaching the
living how to die. At the same time, I can well understand
that there may be occasions when another service
will be required, or when an irresistible impulse may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
change the chaplain into the soldier.</p>

<p>An eminent writer of our age, the late Lord Macaulay,
has said positively that a clergyman should never
fight. The motion which I make has no such extent.
It simply proposes that the law shall not require him
to fight.</p>

<p>In former days bishops have worn coats of mail and
led embattled forces, and there are many instances where
the chaplain has assumed all the duties of the soldier.</p>

<p>At the famous Battle of Fontenoy, where the French,
under Marshal Saxe, prevailed over the united armies
of England, Austria, and Holland, there was a British
chaplain, with a name subsequently historic, who by
military service acquired the title of “The Fighting
Chaplain of Fontenoy.” This was the renowned Edinburgh
professor, Adam Ferguson, author of the “History
of the Roman Republic.” And only a few days ago
I presented a petition for a pension from the widow of
Rev. Arthur B. Fuller, chaplain, who fell fighting at
Fredericksburg. But these instances are exceptional.
Legislation cannot be founded on exceptions.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>In reply to other Senators, Mr. Sumner spoke again.</p>

</div>

<p>The Senate is engaged in maturing a permanent law,&mdash;not
merely for a year, not only for the present Rebellion,
not for any exigency of the day, but an enduring
statute,&mdash;and as such it will be a record of the sentiments
and the civilization of our time. But I am not
disposed to present this question on any ground of
sentiment, though such an appeal would be difficult
to answer.</p>

<p>Time is pr<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>ecious, and I content myself with another
appeal,&mdash;I mean to practical experience. I think I do
not err, when I say, that, in the history of the Christian
world, you will not find a single evidence of a country
where clergymen have been compelled to serve as soldiers,&mdash;at
least I do not recall such instance,&mdash;while
the most military country of modern times has refused
to sanction the compulsion. I have before me the well-considered
military statute of France, where everything
was matured with the greatest care and consideration,
and so as to secure the largest amount of service. No
exemption was recognized, except after conscientious
debate and for sufficient reason. Therefore this statute
is testimony of the highest character. But here I find
exemption, not only of the clergy, including all denominations
recognized by the State, but also of students of
divinity preparing to enter the ministry. If not absolutely
indifferent to practical experience, the example
of a military people like the French, especially in exemptions
from conscription, cannot be neglected. I
doubt if we shall lose by following it.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Wilson then said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If they cannot bear arms, if they cannot perform military duty, they at
any rate can furnish a substitute, or pay the sum provided for, be that more
or less.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Sumner replied:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>I do not understand that our clergy throughout the
United States are rich. In some of the larger towns they
may be comparatively so, but in the country such is not
the case. Goldsmith’s village preacher, “passing rich
with forty pounds a year,”&mdash;that is, about two hundred

<p>From the beginning of the Rebellion there had been constant anxiety
lest foreign powers, especially England and France, should intervene
in some way, by diplomacy, if not by arms. As early as July,
1861, Russia made an offer of its good offices between the contending
parties, with warm expressions for the integrity of the Union; but these
were promptly declined.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> In October, 1862, the French Emperor instructed
his ambassadors at London and St. Petersburg to propose the
coöperation of the three Cabinets in obtaining a suspension of arms
for six months, and, if required, to be prolonged further, during which
every act of war, direct or indirect, should provisionally cease, on sea
and land. The Cabinets of England and St. Petersburg both declined
the proposition.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> The French Emperor then proceeded alone. By a
despatch of M. Drouyn de Lhuys, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, to M.
Mercier, the Minister at Washington, dated January 9, 1863, his good
offices were tendered to the United States, in the view of facilitating negotiations
between the contending parties; but these were declined by
Mr. Seward, in a despatch to Mr. Dayton at Paris, February 6, 1863.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile there were suggestions in the English press, and also in
Parliament, of intervention in some form. Sometimes it was proposed
that the independence of the Rebels should be acknowledged.</p>

<p>The proposition from the French Emperor and the reply of Mr. Seward,
being communicated to the Senate, were, on motion of Mr. Sumner,
referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations, and February
28th he reported the following resolutions.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span><span class="smcap">Concurrent Resolutions of Congress concerning Foreign
Intervention in the existing Rebellion.</span></p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Whereas it appears from the diplomatic correspondence
submitted to Congress, that a proposition,
friendly in form, looking to pacification through
foreign mediation, has been made to the United States
by the Emperor of the French, and promptly declined
by the President; <i>and whereas</i> the idea of mediation
or intervention in some shape may be regarded by foreign
governments as practicable, and such governments,
through this misunderstanding, may be led to proceedings
tending to embarrass the friendly relations which
now exist between them and the United States; <i>and
whereas</i>, in order to remove for the future all chance of
misunderstanding on this subject, and to secure for the
United States the full enjoyment of that freedom from
foreign interference which is one of the highest rights
of independent states, it seems fit that Congress should
manifest its convictions thereon: <i>Therefore</i>&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i> (<i>the House of Representatives concurring</i>),
That, while in times past the United States have sought
and accepted the friendly mediation or arbitration of
foreign powers for the pacific adjustment of <em>international</em>
questions, where the United States were party
of the one part and some other sovereign power party
of the other part; and while they are not disposed to
misconstrue the natural and humane desire of foreign
powers to aid in arresting <em>domestic</em> troubles, which, widening
in influence, have afflicted other countries, especially
in view of the circumstance, deeply regretted by
the American people, that the Rebel blow aimed at the
national life has fallen heavily upon the laboring population
of Europe; yet, notwithstanding these things,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
Congress cannot hesitate to regard every proposition
of foreign interference so far unreasonable and inadmissible,
that its only explanation can be found in a
misunderstanding of the true state of the question, and
of the real character of the war in which the Republic
is engaged.</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That the United States are grappling with
an unprovoked and wicked Rebellion, which is seeking
the destruction of the Republic, that it may build a new
power, whose corner-stone, according to the confession
of its chiefs, shall be Slavery; that for the suppression
of this Rebellion, thus saving the Republic and preventing
the establishment of such a power, the National
Government is employing armies and fleets, in full faith
that the purposes of conspirators and rebels will be
crushed; that, while engaged in this struggle, on which
so much depends, any proposition from a foreign power,
whatever form it take, having for object the arrest
of these efforts, is, just in proportion to its influence,
an encouragement to the Rebellion, and to its declared
pretensions, and on this account is calculated to prolong
and embitter the conflict, to cause increased expenditure
of blood and treasure, and to postpone the
much desired day of peace; that, with these convictions,
and not doubting that every such proposition,
although made with good intent, is injurious to the
national interests, Congress will be obliged to look
upon any further attempt in the same direction as
an unfriendly act, which it earnestly deprecates, to the
end that nothing may occur abroad to strengthen the
Rebellion, or to weaken those relations of good-will
with foreign powers which the United States are happy
to cultivate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That the Rebellion, from its beginning, and
far back even in the conspiracy which preceded its outbreak,
was encouraged by hope of support from foreign
powers; that its chiefs constantly represented the people
of Europe as so far dependent upon regular supplies
of the great Southern staple, that, sooner or later, their
governments would be constrained to take side with
the Rebellion in some effective form, even to the extent
of forcible intervention, if the milder form did not
prevail; that the Rebellion is now sustained by this
hope, which every proposition of foreign interference
quickens anew, and that without this life-giving support
it must soon yield to the just and paternal authority
of the National Government; that, considering these
things, which are aggravated by the motive of the resistance
thus encouraged, the United States regret that
foreign powers have not frankly told the chiefs of the
Rebellion that the work in which they are engaged is
hateful, and that a new government, such as they seek
to found, with Slavery as its acknowledged corner-stone,
and with no other declared object of separate existence,
is so far shocking to civilization and the moral sense of
mankind that it must not expect welcome or recognition
in the Commonwealth of Nations.</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That the United States, confident in the
justice of their cause, which is the cause of good government
and of human rights everywhere among men,
anxious for the speedy restoration of peace, which shall
establish tranquillity at home and remove all occasion
of complaint abroad, and awaiting with well-assured
trust the final suppression of the Rebellion, through
which all these things, rescued from present peril, will
be secured forever, and the Republic, one and indivisible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
triumphant over its enemies, will continue an example
to mankind, <span class="smcap">hereby announce</span>, as their unalterable purpose,
that the war will be vigorously prosecuted, according
to the humane principles of Christian nations, until
the Rebellion is overcome; and they reverently invoke
upon their cause the blessing of Almighty God.</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That the President be requested to transmit
a copy of these resolutions, through the Secretary of
State, to the ministers of the United States in foreign
countries, that the protest and declaration herein set
forth may be communicated by them to the governments
near which they reside.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>March 3d, on motion of Mr. Sumner, the Senate proceeded to consider
the resolutions. In reply to Mr. Powell, of Kentucky, he remarked:
“The resolutions speak for themselves, and I content myself
by simply asking for a vote.” Then, in reply to Mr. Carlile, of West
Virginia, he said: “These resolutions proceed from the spontaneous
deliberations of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, without a
suggestion or hint from the Secretary of State or from any member of
the Administration; but I am able to state, that, since the resolutions
have been reported, they have the entire and cordial approval of the
Secretary of State, who has authorized me to say that he takes a special
interest in their adoption by Congress.”</p>

<p>The resolutions passed the Senate by a vote of 31 yeas to 5 nays.
On the same day they passed the House of Representatives,&mdash;Yeas
103, Nays 28.</p>

<p>Being concurrent resolutions of the two Houses, and not a joint resolution,
they were never submitted to the President for approval; but,
according to the request in the last resolution, they were communicated
by the Secretary of State in an official note to our ministers abroad.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The reception of these resolutions at the time will appear by an extract
from the <i>Evening Post</i> of New York.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Mr. Sumner’s resolutions, which have so triumphantly passed the National
Le<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>gislature, and which receive at the same time the cordial approval
of the President and the Cabinet, will deepen and justify the feeling in our
favor. They define our position with a distinctness that has not always been
attained in our official acts. They describe boldly and vividly the nature
of the Rebellion which has destroyed our peace, tracing it wholly to the
ambition and selfishness of the Slaveholders, and warning foreign nations
of the awful crime they commit in lending their aid to such an infamous
assault upon all the principles of orderly government, all the rights of humanity,
and all the best interests of Christian civilization. Every reflective
mind in Europe will know, after reading them, that whatever encourages
the Rebellion will encourage the most odious tyranny that human cupidity
ever devised.”</p>

<p>The following letter, which appeared in the papers at the time, was
written in the hope of preventing any action under the law of Congress
authorizing letters of marque.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right medium"><span class="smcap">Washington</span>, March 17, 1863.</p>

<p class="dropcap">MY DEAR SIR,&mdash;In the freedom of that conversation
which I had with you as we drove to the
Capitol recently, allow me for a moment to speak again
on the question which interested us then.…</p>

<p>I confess that I am anxious that the issuing of letters
of marque should be avoided, not merely because
it will give us a bad name without commensurate good,
nor because it will be a departure from the early and
often declared policy of our Government, which has not
hesitated, by the pen of Benjamin Franklin and John
Quincy Adams, to denounce privateering as an “enormity,”
but because it does not meet, in a practical way,
the precise necessity of this time. People who advocate
it are obviously misled by the experience of another
generation, when we were at war with a nation whose
commerce was a temptation and a reward to private
enterprise. The case is so different now that the old
agency is entirely inapplicable.</p>

<p>The privateer cruises for booty, which is in lieu of
rations and pay to officers and men, and of hire and
compensation to owners. But if the booty does not
exist, or if it is in such inconsiderable quantity a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>s to
afford small chance of valuable prize, evidently you must
find some other system of compensation; as this cannot
be, you must abandon the idea of private enterprise
stimulated and sustained by booty. An agency must
be found applicable to the present case, precisely as in
machinery a force is found best calculated to do the
required work.</p>

<p>Now our present business is to help the Government
capture the Alabama and her piratical comrades, and
also to catch blockade-runners. But a letter of marque
is not proper for this purpose, nor will the chance of
booty be the best way to stimulate and sustain the
cruiser, while, on the other hand, it is obvious that
such a ship, invested with the belligerent right of
search, in the quest of booty, will be tempted to exercise
it on neutral commerce, and thus become the occasion
of contention and strife with foreign powers.</p>

<p>Privateers have never been remarkable for the caution
or reserve with which they employ belligerent rights. I
would not exaggerate the troubles that might ensue; but
when I think of these sea-rovers, with license to overhaul
neutral ships and to inflict upon them visitation
and search, I feel how much evil may ensue compared
with the good. You would not threaten a whole street
in order to catch a few robbers who had sought shelter
in some of its recesses, nor would you burn down your
house, according to the amusing story of Charles Lamb,
in order to roast a pig.</p>

<p>It seems to be only according to common prudence,
that private enterprise, if enlisted now, should be regulated
by the object in view. To this end, it is not necessary
that it should assume a form calculated to awaken
solicitude. The way is simple. If citizens are willing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
to unite in efforts of the Government, let them place
their ships at its disposal, to be commissioned as national
ships, and let the Government, on its part, offer bounty
and prize money, in addition to pay and rations, for the
capture of the Alabama and her piratical comrades. The
motive power will thus be adapted to the object, while
our country will be saved from all chance of additional
complication, and also from the stigma of reviving a policy
which civilization condemns.</p>

<p>The argument of economy is sometimes pressed. But
it is poor economy to employ an agency which in its
very nature is inapplicable. Besides, I doubt if any
success reasonably expected from such ships, called by
the French <i>corsaires</i>, will be a compensation for the bad
name they will give us, and the bad passions they will
engender.</p>

<p>I hope I do not take too great a liberty in sending
you this sequel to our conversation. At all events, you
will be pleased to accept my best wishes, and believe
me, my dear Sir, with much regard,</p>

invitation with which you have honored me.</p>

<p>If it were my privilege to speak on that occasion,
I should urge upon my fellow-citizens everywhere the
duty of <em>Unity for the sake of Freedom</em>, and also of <em>Freedom

They are mutually dependent. Let this people
continue united, and Freedom must surely prevail. Let
Freedom prevail, and this people cannot cease to be
united.</p>

<p>With such a cause, there is but one side and one duty.
Whoever is for the Unity of the Republic must be for
Freedom, and whoever is for Freedom must be for the
Unity of the Republic. It is vain to think that one
can be advanced without the other. Whoever is against
one is against the other, and whoever is lukewarm for
one is lukewarm for the other. We must be fervid and
strong for both.</p>

<p class="dropcap">GENTLEMEN,&mdash;I have always voted for the Pacific
Railroad, and now that it is authorized by
Congress I follow it with hope and confidence. It is
a great work, but science has already shown it to be
practicable.</p>

<p>Let the road be built, and its influence will be incalculable.
People will wonder that the world lived so
long without it.</p>

<p>Conjoining the two oceans, it will be an agency of
matchless power, not only commercial, but political. It
will be a new girder to the Union, a new help to business,
and a new charm to life. Perhaps the imagination
is most impressed by the thought of travel and merchandise
winding their way from Atlantic to Pacific in
one unbroken line; but I incline to believe that the
commercial advantages will be more apparent in the opportunities
the railroad will create and quicken everywhere
on the way. New homes and new towns will
spring up, making new demand for labor and supplies.
Civilization will be projected into the forest and over
the plain, while the desert is made to yield its increase.
There is no productiveness to compare with that from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
the upturned sod which receives the iron rail. In its
crop are school-houses and churches, cities and states.</p>

<p>In this vast undertaking coöperation of all kinds is
needed, and it will be rewarded too. Capitalists, bankers,
merchants, engineers, mechanics, miners, laborers,
all must enlist. Perhaps there will be a place also for
<em>the freedmen of this war</em>, although it seems to me that
their services can be more effectively bestowed at home,
as laborers and soldiers. But I see not why emigrants
should not be invited from Europe to take part
in this honorable service, and share the prosperity it
will surely organize. Let them quit poverty, dependence,
and wretchedness in their own country, for good
wages here, with independence, and a piece of ground
which each man can call his own.</p>

<p>Emigration will hasten the work; but, with or without
emigration, it must proceed. Everywhere, from sunrise
to sunset, the Rail and Wheel, which an eminent
English engineer has pronounced “man and wife,” will
yet be welcomed, sure to become the parents of a mighty
progeny.</p>

report of your powerful and well-organized meeting at
Chicago, without taking part in it.</p>

<p>The proposition to unite the greatest navigable river
of the world with the greatest inland sea is characteristic
of the West. Each is worthy of the other. The
idea of joining these together strikes the imagination
as original. But the highest beauty is in utility, which
will not be wanting here. With this union, the Gulf
of Mexico will be joined to the Gulf of St. Lawrence,
and the whole continent, from Northern cold to Southern
heat, traversed by one generous flood, bearing upon
its bosom untold commerce.</p>

<p>It is for the West to consider well the conditions of
this enterprise, and the advantages it will secure. Let
its practicability be demonstrated, and the country will
command it to be done, as it has already commanded
the opening of the Mississippi. Triumphant over the
wickedness of an accursed Rebellion, we shall achieve
another triumph, to take its place among the victor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>ies
of Peace.</p>

<p>To this magnificent work Science will contribute her
myriad resources. But there is something needed even
to quicken and inspire science: it is the unconquerable
will, which does not yield to difficulties, but presses forward
to overcome them. No word is used with more
levity than the word “impossible.” A scientific professor,
in a public address, declared the navigation of the
Atlantic by steam “impossible.” Within a few weeks
it was done. The British Prime-Minister declared the
construction of a canal between the Mediterranean and
the Red Sea “impossible.” The Pacha of Egypt, with
French engineers, is now doing it. Mirabeau was right,
when he protested against the use of this word as simple
stupidity. But I doubt if the word will be found
in any Western dictionary.</p>

<p class="dropcap">It is now more than three years since I deemed it
my duty, in the Senate, to expose the Barbarism of
Slavery. This phrase, though common now, was new
then. The speech was a reply, strict and logical, to
assumptions of Senators, asserting the “divine origin”
of Slavery, its “ennobling” character, and that it was
the “black marble keystone” of our national arch.
Listening to these assumptions, which were of daily
recurrence, I felt that they ought to be answered; and
considering their effrontery, it seemed to me that they
should be answered frankly and openly, by exhibiting
Slavery <em>as it really is</em>, without reserve,&mdash;careful that I
should “nothing extenuate, nor set down aught in
malice.” This I did.</p>

<p>In that debate was joined the issue still pending in
the Trial by Battle. The inordinate assumptions for
Slavery naturally ripened in Rebellion and War. If
Slavery were in reality all that was claimed by its
representatives, they must have failed in duty, if they
did not vindicate and advance it. Not easily could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
they see a thing so “divine” and so “ennobling,” constituting
the “black marble keystone” of our national
arch, discredited by popular vote, even if not yet consigned
to sacrifice.</p>

<p>The election of Mr. Lincoln was a judgment against
Slavery, and its representatives were aroused.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, for more than a generation, an assumption
of Constitutional Law, hardly less baleful, had
become rooted side by side with Slavery, so that the
two shot up in rank luxuriance together. It was assumed,
that, under the Constitution, a State was privileged
at any time, in the exercise of its own discretion,
to withdraw from the Union. This absurdity found
little favor at first, even among the representatives of
Slavery. To say that two and two make five could not
be more irrational. But custom and constant repetition
gradually produced an impression, until, at last, all the
maddest for Slavery were the maddest also for this disorganizing
ally.</p>

<p>It was then, conjoined with this constitutional assumption,
that the assumption for Slavery grew into
noxious vigor, so that, at last, when Mr. Lincoln was
elected, it broke forth in flagrant war; but the war was
declared in the name of State Rights.</p>

<p>Therefore there are two <em>apparent</em> rudiments to this
war. One is Slavery, and the other is State Rights.
But the latter is only a cover for the former. If Slavery
were out of the way, there would be no trouble
from State Rights.</p>

<p>The war, then, is for Slavery, and nothing else. It is
an insane attempt by arms to vindicate the lordship
asserted in debate. With madcap audacity it seeks to
install this Barbarism as the truest Civilization. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>Slavery
is announced as the “corner-stone” of the new
edifice. This is enough.</p>

<p>The question is presented between Barbarism and
Civilization,&mdash;not merely between two different forms
of Civilization, but between Barbarism on the one side
and Civilization on the other side.</p>

<p>Such is the issue, simply stated. On the one side
are women and children at the auction-block, families
rudely separated, human flesh lacerated and seamed by
the bloody scourge, labor extorted without wages; and
all this frightful, many-sided wrong is the declared
foundation of a mock Commonwealth. On the other
side is the Union of our fathers, with the image of
Liberty on its coin and the sentiment of Liberty in
its Constitution, now arrayed under a patriotic Government,
which insists that no such mock Commonwealth,
having such declared foundation, shall be permitted on
the national territory, purchased with money and blood,
to impair the unity of our jurisdiction, and to insult
the moral sense of mankind.</p>

<p>Therefore the battle waged by the Union is for Civilization
itself, and it must have aid and God-speed
from all not openly for Barbarism. Every one must
give his best efforts, and especially the young men to
whom I now appeal.</p>

<p class="dropcap">DEAR SIR,&mdash;It will not be in my power to take
part in the proposed meeting at Poughkeepsie.
But I am glad it has been called, and I trust it will
be successful.</p>

<p>To me it has been clear from the beginning that the
colored men would be needed in this war. I never for
a moment doubted that they would render good service.
And thus far the evidence in their favor is triumphant.
Nobody now questions their bravery or capacity for discipline.
All that can be said against them is that they
are not “white.”</p>

<p>But they have a special interest in the suppression of
the Rebellion. The enemies of the Union are the enemies
of their race. Therefore, in defending the Union,
they defend themselves even more than other citizens;
and in saving the Union, they save themselves.</p>

<p>I doubt if in times past our country could have justly
expected from colored men any patriotic service. Such
service is the return for protection. But now that protection
has begun, the service should begin also. Nor
should relative rights and duties be weighed with nicety.
It is enough that our country, aroused at last to a sense
of justice, seeks to enroll colored men among its defenders.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
<p>If my counsels could reach such persons, I would say,
Enlist at once. Now is the day, and now the fortunate
hour. Help to overcome your cruel enemies battling
against your country, and in this way you will surely
overcome those other enemies, hardly less cruel, here
at home, who still seek to degrade you. This is not
the time to hesitate or to higgle. Do your duty to our
common country, and you will set an example of generous
self-sacrifice which must conquer prejudice and
open all hearts.</p>

<p>Accept my thanks for the invitation with which you
have honored me, and believe me, dear Sir,</p>

<p class="sig">Very faithfully yours,</p>
